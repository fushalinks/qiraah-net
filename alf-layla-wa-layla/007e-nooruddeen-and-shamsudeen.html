    <h3><a id="chap23" />TALE OF NUR AL-DIN AND HIS SON.</h3>
    <p>Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that in times of yore the land of Egypt was ruled by a Sultan endowed with
      justice and generosity, one who loved the pious poor and companied with the Olema and learned men; and he had a
      Wazir, a wise and an experienced, well versed in affairs and in the art of government. This Minister, who was a
      very old man, had two sons, as they were two moons; never man saw the like of them for beauty and grace, the elder
      called Shams al-Din Mohammed and the younger Nur al-Din Ali; but the younger excelled the elder in seemliness and
      pleasing semblance, so that folk heard his fame in far countries and men flocked to Egypt for the purpose of
      seeing him. In course of time their father, the Wazir, died and was deeply regretted and mourned by the Sultan,
      who sent for his two sons and, investing them with dresses of honour, said to them, "Let not your hearts be
      troubled, for ye shall stand in your father's stead and be joint Ministers of Egypt." At this they rejoiced and
      kissed the ground before him and performed the ceremonial mourning for their father during a full month; after
      which time they entered upon the Wazirate, and the power passed into their hands as it had been in the hands of
      their father, each doing duty for a week at a time. They lived under the same roof and their word was one; and
      whenever the Sultan desired to travel they took it by turns to be in attendance on him. It fortuned one night that
      the Sultan purposed setting out on a journey next morning, and the elder, whose turn it was to accompany him, was
      sitting conversing with his brother and said to him, "O my brother, it is my wish that we both marry, I and thou,
      two sisters; and go in to our wives on one and the same night." "Do, O my brother, as thou desirest," the younger
      replied, "for right is thy recking and surely I will comply with thee in whatso thou sayest." So they agreed upon
      this and quoth Shams al-Din, "If Allah decree that we marry two damsels and go in to them on the same night, and
      they shall conceive on their bridenights and bear children to us on the same day, and by Allah's will they wife
      bear thee a son and my wife bear me a daughter, let us wed them either to other, for they will be cousins." Quoth
      Nur al-Din, "O my brother, Shams al-Din, what dower wilt thou require from my son for thy daughter?" Quoth Shams
      al-Din, "I will take three thousand dinars and three pleasure gardens and three farms; and it would not be seemly
      that the youth make contract for less than this." When Nur al-Din heard such demand he said, "What manner of dower
      is this thou wouldst impose upon my son? Wottest thou not that we are brothers and both by Allah's grace Wazirs
      and equal in office? It behoveth thee to offer thy daughter to my son without marriage settlement; or if one need
      be, it should represent a mere nominal value by way of show to the world: for thou knowest that the masculine is
      worthier than the feminine, and my son is a male and our memory will be preserved by him, not by thy daughter."
      "But what," said Shams al-Din, "is she to have?"; and Nur al-Din continued, "Through her we shall not be
      remembered among the Emirs of the earth; but I see thou wouldest do with me according to the saying:—An thou
      wouldst bluff off a buyer, ask him high price and higher; or as did a man who, they say, went to a friend and
      asked something of him being in necessity and was answered, 'Bismallah, in the name of Allah, I will do all what
      thou requirest but come to-morrow!' Whereupon the other replied in this verse:—</p>
    <p>'When he who is asked a favour saith "To-morrow," * The wise man wots 'tis vain to beg or borrow.'"</p>
    <p>Quoth Shams al-Din, "Basta! I see thee fail in respect to me by making thy son of more account than my daughter;
      and 'tis plain that thine understanding is of the meanest and that thou lackest manners. Thou remindest me of thy
      partnership in the Wazirate, when I admitted thee to share with me only in pity for thee, and not wishing to
      mortify thee; and that thou mightest help me as a manner of assistant. But since thou talkest on this wise, by
      Allah, I will never marry my daughter to thy son; no, not for her weight in gold!" When Nur al-Din heard his
      brother's words he waxed wroth and said, "And I too, I will never, never marry my son to thy daughter; no, not to
      keep from my lips the cup of death." Shams al-Din replied, "I would not accept him as a husband for her, and he is
      not worth a paring of her nail. Were I not about to travel I would make an example of thee; however when I return
      thou shalt see, and I will show thee, how I can assert my dignity and vindicate my honour. But Allah doeth whatso
      He willeth." When Nur al-Din heard this speech from his brother, he was filled with fury and lost his wits for
      rage; but he hid what he felt and held his peace; and each of the brothers passed the night in a place far apart,
      wild with wrath against the other. As soon as morning dawned the Sultan fared forth in state and crossed over from
      Cairo to Jizah and made for the pyramids, accompanied by the Wazir Shams al-Din, whose turn of duty it was, whilst
      his brother Nur al-din, who passed the night in sore rage, rose with the light and prayed the dawn-prayer. Then he
      betook himself to his treasury and, taking a small pair of saddle-bags, filled them with gold; and he called to
      mind his brother's threats and the contempt wherewith he had treated him, and he repeated these couplets:—</p>
    <p>"Travel! and thou shalt find new friends for old ones left<br />
           behind; * Toil! for the sweets of human life by toil and<br />
           moil are found:<br />
      The stay-at-home no honour wins nor aught attains but want; * So<br />
           leave thy place of birth and wander all the world<br />
           around!<br />
      I've seen, and very oft I've seen, how standing water stinks, *<br />
           And only flowing sweetens it and trotting makes it sound:<br />
      And were the moon forever full and ne'er to wax or wane, * Man<br />
           would not strain his watchful eyes to see its gladsome<br />
           round:<br />
      Except the lion leave his lair he ne'er would fell his game, *<br />
           Except the arrow leave the bow ne'er had it reached its<br />
           bound:<br />
      Gold-dust is dust the while it lies untravelled in the mine, *<br />
           And aloes-wood mere fuel is upon its native ground:<br />
      And gold shall win his highest worth when from his goal ungoal'd;<br />
           * And aloes sent to foreign parts grows costlier than gold."<br /></p>
    <p>When he ended his verse he bade one of his pages saddle him his Nubian mare-mule with her padded selle. Now she
      was a dapple- grey, with ears like reed-pens and legs like columns and a back high and strong as a dome builded on
      pillars; her saddle was of gold-cloth and her stirrups of Indian steel, and her housing of Ispahan velvet; she had
      trappings which would serve the Chosroes, and she was like a bride adorned for her wedding night. Moreover he bade
      lay on her back a piece of silk for a seat, and a prayer-carpet under which were his saddle-bags. When this was
      done he said to his pages and slaves, "I purpose going forth a-pleasuring outside the city on the road to
      Kalyub-town, and I shall lie three nights abroad; so let none of you follow me, for there is something straiteneth
      my breast." Then he mounted the mule in haste; and, taking with him some provaunt for the way, set out from Cairo
      and faced the open and uncultivated country lying around it. About noontide he entered Bilbays-city, where he
      dismounted and stayed awhile to rest himself and his mule and ate some of his victual. He bought at Bilbays all he
      wanted for himself and forage for his mule and then fared on the way of the waste. Towards night-fall he entered a
      town called Sa'adiyah where he alighted and took out somewhat of his viaticum and ate; then he spread his strip of
      silk on the sand and set the saddle-bags under his head and slept in the open air; for he was still overcome with
      anger. When morning dawned he mounted and rode onward till he reached the Holy City, Jerusalem, and thence he made
      Aleppo, where he dismounted at one of the caravanserais and abode three days to rest himself and the mule and to
      smell the air. Then, being determined to travel afar and Allah having written safety in his fate, he set out
      again, wending without wotting whither he was going; and, having fallen in with certain couriers, he stinted not
      travelling till he had reached Bassorah- city albeit he knew not what the place was. It was dark night when he
      alighted at the Khan, so he spread out his prayer-carpet and took down the saddle-bags from the back of his mule
      and gave her with her furniture in charge of the door-keeper that he might walk her about. The man took her and
      did as he was bid. Now it so happened that the Wazir of Bassorah, a man shot in years, was sitting at the
      lattice-window of his palace opposite the Khan and he saw the porter walking the mule up and down. He was struck
      by her trappings of price and thought her a nice beast fit for the riding of Wazirs or even of royalties; and the
      more he looked the more was he perplexed till at last he said to one of his pages, "Bring hither yon door-keeper,"
      The page went and returned to the Wazir with the porter who kissed the ground between his hands, and the Minister
      asked him, "Who is the owner of yonder mule and what manner of man is he?"; and he answered, "O my lord, the owner
      of this mule is a comely young man of pleasant manners, withal grave and dignified, and doubtless one of the sons
      of the merchants." When the Wazir heard the door-keeper's words he arose forthright; and, mounting his horse, rode
      to the Khan and went in to Nur al-Din who, seeing the minister making towards him, rose to his feet and advanced
      to meet him and saluted him. The Wazir welcomed him to Bassorah and dis- mounting, embraced him and made him sit
      down by his side and said, "O my son, whence comest thou and what dost thou seek?" "O my lord," Nur al-Din
      replied, "I have come from Cairo-city of which my father was whilome Wazir; but he hath been removed to the grace
      of Allah;" and he informed him of all that had befallen him from beginning to end, adding, "I am resolved never to
      return home before I have seen all the cities and countries of the world." When the Wazir heard this, he said to
      him, "O my son, hearken not to the voice of passion lest it cast thee into the pit; for indeed many regions be
      waste places and I fear for thee the turns of Time." Then he let load the saddle-bags and the silk and
      prayer-carpets on the mule and carried Nur al-Din to his own house, where he lodged him in a pleasant place and
      entreated him honourably and made much of him, for he inclined to love him with exceeding love. After a while he
      said to him, "O my son, here am I left a man in years and have no male children, but Allah hath blessed me with a
      daughter who eventh thee in beauty; and I have rejected all her many suitors, men of rank and substance. But
      affection for thee hath entered into my heart; say me, then, wilt thou be to her a husband? If thou accept this, I
      will go up with thee to the Sultan of Bassorah and will tell him that thou art my nephew, the son of my brother,
      and bring thee to be appointed Wazir in my place that I may keep the house for, by Allah, O my son, I am stricken
      in years and aweary." When Nur al-Din heard the Wazir's words, he bowed his head in modesty and said, "To hear is
      to obey!" At this the Wazir rejoiced and bade his servants prepare a feast and decorate the great assembly-hall,
      wherein they were wont to celebrate the marriages of Emirs and Grandees. Then he assembled his friends and the
      notables of the reign and the merchants of Bassorah and when all stood before him he said to them, "I had a
      brother who was Wazir in the land of Egypt, and Allah Almighty blessed him with two sons, whilst to me, as well ye
      wot, He hath given a daughter. My brother charged me to marry my daughter to one of his sons, whereto I assented;
      and, when my daughter was of age to marry, he sent me one of his sons, the young man now present, to whom I
      purpose marrying her, drawing up the contract and celebrating the night of unveiling with due ceremony; for he is
      nearer and dearer to me than a stranger and, after the wedding, if he please he shall abide with me, or if he
      desire to travel I will forward him and his wife to his father's home." Hereat one and all replied, "Right is thy
      recking;" and they all looked at the bridegroom and were pleased with him. So the Wazir sent for the Kazi and
      legal witnesses and they wrote out the marriage- contract, after which the slaves perfumed the guests with
      incense, and served them with sherbet of sugar and sprinkled rose-water on them and all went their ways. Then the
      Wazir bade his servants take Nur al-Din to the Hammam-baths and sent him a suit of the best of his own especial
      raiment, and napkins and towelry and bowls and perfume-burners and all else that was required. After the bath,
      when he came out and donned the dress, he was even as the full moon on the fourteenth night; and he mounted his
      mule and stayed not till he reached the Wazir's palace. There he dismounted and went in to the Minister and kissed
      his hands, and the Wazir bade him welcome.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
      say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Twenty-first Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir stood up to him and welcoming him said, "Arise
      and go in to thy wife this night, and on the morrow I will carry thee to the Sultan, and pray Allah bless thee
      with all manner of weal." So Nur al-Din left him and went into his wife the Wazir's daughter. Thus far concerning
      him, but as regards his eldest brother, Shams al-Din, he was absent with the Sultan a long time and when he
      returned from his journey he found not his brother; and he asked of his servants and slaves who answered, "On the
      day of thy departure with the Sultan, thy brother mounted his mule fully caparisoned as for state procession
      saying, 'I am going towards Kalyub-town and I shall be absent one day or at most two days; for my breast is
      straitened, and let none of you follow me.' Then he fared forth and from that time to this we have heard no
      tidings of him." Shams al-Din was greatly troubled at the sudden disappearance of his brother and grieved with
      exceeding grief at the loss and said to himself, "This is only because I chided and upbraided him the night before
      my departure with the Sultan; haply his feelings were hurt and he fared forth a-travelling; but I must send after
      him." Then he went in to the Sultan and acquainted him with what had happened and wrote letters and dispatches,
      which he sent by running footmen to his deputies in every province. But during the twenty days of his brother's
      absence Nur al-Din had travelled far and had reached Bassorah; so after diligent search the messengers failed to
      come at any news of him and returned. Thereupon Shams al-Din despaired of finding his brother and said, "Indeed I
      went beyond all bounds in what I said to him with reference to the marriage of our children. Would that I had not
      done so! This all cometh of my lack of wit and want of caution." Soon after this he sought in marriage the
      daughter of a Cairene merchant, and drew up the marriage contract and went in to her. And it so chanced that, on
      the very same night when Shams al-Din went in to his wife, Nur al-Din also went in to his wife the daughter of the
      Wazir of Bassorah; this being in accordance with the will of Almighty Allah, that He might deal the decrees of
      Destiny to His creatures. Furthermore, it was as the two brothers had said; for their two wives became pregnant by
      them on the same night and both were brought to bed on the same day; the wife of Shams al-Din, Wazir of Egypt, of
      a daughter, never in Cairo was seen a fairer; and the wife of Nur al-Din of a son, none more beautiful was ever
      seen in his time, as one of the poets said concerning the like of him:—</p>
    <p>That jetty hair, that glossy brow,<br />
           My slender-waisted youth, of thine,<br />
      Can darkness round creation throw,<br />
           Or make it brightly shine.<br />
      The dusky mole that faintly shows<br />
           Upon his cheek, ah! blame it not:<br />
      The tulip-flower never blows<br />
           Undarkened by its spot <br /></p>
    <p>And as another also said:—</p>
    <p>His scent was musk and his cheek was rose; * His teeth are pearls<br />
           and his lips drop wine;<br />
      His form is a brand and his hips a hill; * His hair is night and<br />
           his face moon-shine.<br /></p>
    <p>They named the boy Badr al-Din Hasan and his grandfather, the Wazir of Bassorah, rejoiced in him and, on the
      seventh day after his birth, made entertainments and spread banquets which would befit the birth of Kings' sons
      and heirs. Then he took Nur al- Din and went up with him to the Sultan, and his son-in-law, when he came before
      the presence of the King, kissed the ground between his hands and repeated these verses, for he was ready of
      speech, firm of sprite and good in heart as he was goodly in form:—</p>
    <p>"The world's best joys long be thy lot, my lord! * And last while<br />
           darkness and the dawn o'erlap:<br />
      O thou who makest, when we greet thy gifts, * The world to dance<br />
           and Time his palms to clap." <br /></p>
    <p>Then the Sultan rose up to honour them, and thanking Nur al-Din for his fine compliment, asked the Wazir, "Who
      may be this young man?"; and the Minister answered, "This is my brother's son," and related his tale from first to
      last. Quoth the Sultan, "And how comes he to be thy nephew and we have never heard speak of him?" Quoth the
      Minister, "O our lord the Sultan, I had a brother who was Wazir in the land of Egypt and he died, leaving two
      sons, whereof the elder hath taken his father's place and the younger, whom thou seest, came to me. I had sworn I
      would not marry my daughter to any but to him; so when he came I married him to her. Now he is young and I am old;
      my hearing is dulled and my judgement is easily fooled; wherefore I would solicit our lord the Sultan to set him
      in my stead, for he is my brother's son and my daughter's husband; and he is fit for the Wazirate, being a man of
      good counsel and ready contrivance." The Sultan looked at Nur al-Din and liked him, so he stablished him in office
      as the Wazir had requested and formally appointed him, presenting him with a splendid dress of honour and a she-
      mule from his private stud; and assigning to him solde, stipends and supplies. Nur al-Din kissed the Sultan's hand
      and went home, he and his father-in-law, joying with exceeding joy and saying, "All this followeth on the heels of
      the boy Hasan's birth!" Next day he presented himself before the King and, kissing the ground, began repeating:—
    </p>
    <p>"Grow thy weal and thy welfare day by day: * And thy luck<br />
           prevail o'er the envier's spite;<br />
      And ne'er cease thy days to be white as day, * And thy foeman's<br />
           day to be black as night!"<br /></p>
    <p>The Sultan bade him be seated on the Wazir's seat, so he sat down and applied himself to the business of his
      office and went into the cases of the lieges and their suits, as is the wont of Ministers; while the Sultan
      watched him and wondered at his wit and good sense, judgement and insight. Wherefor he loved him and took him into
      intimacy. When the Divan was dismissed Nur al-Din returned to his house and related what had passed to his father-
      in-law who rejoiced. And thenceforward Nur al-Din ceased not so to administer the Wazirate that the Sultan would
      not be parted from him night or day; and increased his stipend and supplies until his means were ample and he
      became the owner of ships that made trading voyages at his command, as well as of Mamelukes and blackamoor slaves;
      and he laid out many estates and set up Persian wheels and planted gardens. When his son Hasan was four years of
      age, the old Wazir deceased and he made for his father- in-law a sumptuous funeral ceremony ere he was laid in the
      dust. Then he occupied himself with the education of this son and, when the boy waxed strong and came to the age
      of seven, he brought him a Fakih, a doctor of law and religion, to teach him in his own house and charged him to
      give him a good education and instruct him in politeness and manners. So the tutor made the boy read and retain
      all varieties of useful knowledge, after he had spent some years in learning the Koran by heart; and he ceased not
      to grow in beauty and stature and symmetry, even as saith the poet:—</p>
    <p>In his face-sky shines the fullest moon; * In his cheeks' anemone<br />
           glows the sun:<br />
      He so conquered Beauty that he hath won * All charms of<br />
           humanity one by one.<br /></p>
    <p>The professor brought him up in his father's palace teaching him reading, writing and cyphering, theology and
      belles lettres. His grandfather the old Wazir had bequeathed to him the whole of his property when he was but four
      years of age. Now during all the time of his earliest youth he had never left the house, till on a certain day his
      father, the Wazir Nur al-Din, clad him in his best clothes and, mounting him on a she-mule of the finest, went up
      with him to the Sultan. The King gazed at Badr al-Din Hasan and marvelled at his comeliness and loved him. As for
      the city- folk, when he first passed before them with his father, they marvelled at his exceeding beauty and sat
      down on the road expecting his return, that they might look their fill on his beauty and loveliness and symmetry
      and perfect grace; even as the poet said in these verses:—</p>
    <p>As the sage watched the stars, the semblance clear<br />
      Of a fair youth on 's scroll he saw appear.<br />
      Those jetty locks Canopus o'er him threw,<br />
      And tinged his temple curls a musky hue;<br />
      Mars dyed his ruddy cheek; and from his eyes<br />
      The Archer-star his glittering arrow flies;<br />
      His wit from Hermes came; and Soha's care,<br />
      (The half-seen star that dimly haunts the Bear)<br />
      Kept off all evil eyes that threaten and ensnare,<br />
      The sage stood mazed to see such fortunes meet,<br />
      And Luna kissed the earth beneath his feet. <br /></p>
    <p>And they blessed him aloud as he passed and called upon Almighty Allah to bless him. The Sultan entreated the lad
      with especial favour and said to his father, "O Wazir, thou must needs bring him daily to my presence;" whereupon
      he replied, "I hear and I obey." Then the Wazir returned home with his son and ceased not to carry him to court
      till he reached the age of twenty. At that time the Minister sickened and, sending for Badr al-Din Hasan, said to
      him, "Know, O my son, that the world of the Present is but a house of mortality, while that of the Future is a
      house of eternity. I wish, before I die, to bequeath thee certain charges and do thou take heed of what I say and
      incline thy heart to my words." Then he gave him last instructions as to the properest way of dealing with his
      neighbours and the due management of his affairs; after which he called to mind his brother and his home and his
      native land and wept over his separation from those he had first loved. Then he wiped away his tears and, turning
      to his son, said to him, "Before I proceed, O my son, to my last charges and injunctions, know that I have a
      brother, and thou hast an uncle, Shams al-Din hight, the Wazir of Cairo, which whom I parted, leaving him against
      his will. Now take thee a sheet of paper and write upon it whatso I say to thee." Badr al-Din took a fair leaf and
      set about doing his father's bidding and he wrote thereon a full account of what had happened to his sire first
      and last; the dates of his arrival at Bassorah and of his foregathering with the Wazir; of his marriage, of his
      going in to the Minister's daughter and of the birth of his son; brief, his life of forty years from the date of
      his dispute with his brother, adding the words, "And this is written at my dictation and may Almighty Allah be
      with him when I am gone!" Then he folded the paper and sealed it and said, "O Hasan, O my son, keep this paper
      with all care; for it will enable thee to stablish thine origin and rank and lineage and, if anything contrary
      befal thee, set out for Cairo and ask for thine uncle and show him this paper and say to him that I died a
      stranger far from mine own people and full of yearning to see him and them." So Badr al-Din Hasan took the
      document and folded it; and, wrapping it up in a piece of waxed cloth of his skull-cap and wound his light turband
      round it. And he fell to weeping over his father and at parting with him, and he but a boy. Then Nur al-Din lapsed
      into a swoon, the forerunner of death; but presently recovering himself he said, "O Hasan, O my son, I will now
      bequeath to thee five last behests. The FIRST BEHEST is, Be over-intimate with none, nor frequent any, nor be
      familiar with any; so shalt thou be safe from his mischief; for security lieth in seclusion of thought and a
      certain retirement from the society of thy fellows; and I have heard it said by a poet:—</p>
    <p>In this world there is none thou mayst count upon * To befriend<br />
           thy case in the nick of need:<br />
      So live for thyself nursing hope of none * Such counsel I give<br />
           thee: enow, take heed!<br /></p>
    <p>The SECOND BEHEST is, O my son: Deal harshly with none lest fortune with thee deal hardly; for the fortune of
      this world is one day with thee and another day against thee and all worldly goods are but a loan to be repaid.
      And I have heard a poet say:- -</p>
    <p>Take thought nor hast to win the thing thou wilt; * Have ruth on<br />
           man for ruth thou may'st require:<br />
      No hand is there but Allah's hand is higher; * No tyrant but<br />
           shall rue worse tyrant's ire!<br /></p>
    <p>The THIRD BEHEST is, Learn to be silent in society and let thine own faults distract thine attention from the
      faults of other men: for it is said:—In silence dwelleth safety, and thereon I have heard the lines that tell us:—
    </p>
    <p>Reserve's a jewel, Silence safety is; * Whenas thou speakest many<br />
           a word withhold;<br />
      For an of Silence thou repent thee once, * Of speech thou shalt<br />
           repent times manifold.<br /></p>
    <p>The FOURTH BEHEST, O my son, is Beware of wine-bibbing, for wine is the head of all frowardness and a fine
      solvent of human wits. So shun, and again I say, shun mixing strong liquor; for I have heard a poet say :—</p>
    <p>From wine I turn and whoso wine-cups swill; *<br />
           Becoming one of those who deem it ill:<br />
      Wine driveth man to miss salvation-way, * And opes the<br />
           gateway wide to sins that kill.<br /></p>
    <p>The FIFTH BEHEST, O my son, is Keep thy wealth and it will keep thee; guard thy money and it will guard thee; and
      waste not thy substance lest haply thou come to want and must fare a-begging from the meanest of mankind. Save thy
      dirhams and deem them the sovereignest salve for the wounds of the world. And here again I have heard that one of
      the poets said:—</p>
    <p>When fails my wealth no friend will deign befriend: * When<br />
           wealth abounds all friends their friendship tender:<br />
      How many friends lent aid my wealth to spend; * But friends to<br />
           lack of wealth no friendship render.<br /></p>
    <p>On this wise Nur al-Din ceased not to counsel his son Badr al-Din Hasan till his hour came and, sighing one
      sobbing sigh, his life went forth. Then the voice of mourning and keening rose high in his house and the Sultan
      and all the grandees grieved for him and buried him; but his son ceased not lamenting his loss for two months,
      during which he never mounted horse, nor attended the Divan nor presented himself before the Sultan. At last the
      King, being wroth with him, stablished in his stead one of the Chamberlains and made him Wazir, giving orders to
      seize and set seals on all Nur al-Din's houses and goods and domains. So the new Wazir went forth with a mighty
      posse of Chamberlains and people of the Divan, and watchmen and a host of idlers to do this and to seize Badr
      al-Din Hasan and carry him before the King, who would deal with him as he deemed fit. Now there was among the
      crowd of followers a Mameluke of the deceased Wazir who, when he heard this order, urged his horse and rode at
      full speed to the house of Badr al-Din Hasan; for he cold not endure to see the ruin of his old master's son. He
      found him sitting at the gate with head hung down and sorrowing, as was his wont, for the loss of his father; so
      he dismounted and kissing his hand said to him, "O my lord and son of my lord, haste ere ruin come and lay waste!"
      When Hasan heard this he trembled and asked, "What may be the matter?; and the man answered, "The Sultan is
      angered with thee and hath issued a warrant against thee, and evil cometh hard upon my track; so flee with thy
      life!" At these words Hasan's heart flamed with the fire of bale, and his rose-red cheek turned pale, and he said
      to the "Mameluke, "O my brother, is there time for me to go in and get me some worldly gear which may stand me in
      stead during my strangerhood?" But the slave replied, "O my lord, up at once and save thyself and leave this
      house, while it is yet time." And he quoted these lines:—</p>
    <p>"Escape with thy life, if oppression betide thee, * And let the<br />
           house of its builder's fate!<br />
      Country for country thou'lt find, if thou seek it; * Life for<br />
           life never, early or late.<br />
      It is strange men should dwell in the house of abjection, * When<br />
           the plain of God's earth is so wide and so great!" <br /></p>
    <p>At these words of the Mameluke, Badr al-Din covered his head with the skirt of his garment and went forth on foot
      till he stood outside of the city, where he heard folk saying, "The Sultan hath sent his new Wazir to the house of
      the old Wazir, now no more, to seal his property and seize his son Badr al-Din Hasan and take him before the
      presence, that he may put him to death; " and all cried, "Alas for his beauty and his loveliness!" When he heard
      this he fled forth at hazard, knowing not whither he was going, and gave not over hurrying onwards till Destiny
      drove him to his father's tomb. So he entered the cemetery and, threading his way through the graves, at last he
      reached the sepulchre where he sat down and let fall from his head the skirt of his long robe which was made of
      brocade with a gold-embroidered hem whereon were worked these couplets:—</p>
    <p>O thou whose forehead, like the radiant East, * Tells of the<br />
           stars of Heaven and bounteous dews:<br />
      Endure thine honour to the latest day, * And Time thy growth of<br />
           glory ne'er refuse!<br /></p>
    <p>While he was sitting by his father's tomb behold, there came to him a Jew as he were a Shroff, a money-changer,
      with a pair of saddle-bags containing much gold, who accosted him and kissed his hand, saying, "Whither bound, O
      my lord; 'tis late in the day and thou art clad but lightly, and I read signs of trouble in thy face?" "I was
      sleeping within this very hour," answered Hasan, "when my father appeared to me and chid me for not having visited
      his tomb; so I awoke trembling and came hither forthright lest the day should go by without my visiting him, which
      would have been grievous to me." "O my lord," rejoined the Jew, "thy father had many merchantmen at sea and, as
      some of them are now due, it is my wish to buy of thee the cargo of the first ship that cometh into port with this
      thousand dinars of gold." "I consent," quoth Hasan, whereupon the Jew took out a bag of gold and counted out a
      thousand sequins which he gave to Hasan, the son of the Wazir, saying, "Write me a letter of sale and seal it." So
      Hasan took a pen and paper and wrote these words in duplicate, "The writer, Hasan Badr al-Din, son of Wazir Nur
      al-Din, hath to Isaac the Jew all the cargo of the first of his father's ships which cometh into port, for a
      thousand dinars, and he hath received the price in advance." And after he had taken one copy the Jew put it into
      his pouch and went away; but Hasan fell a-weeping as he thought of the dignity and prosperity which had erst been
      his and he began reciting:—</p>
    <p>"This house, my lady, since you left is now a home no more * For<br />
           me, not neighbours, since you left, prove kind and<br />
           neighbourly:<br />
      The friend, whilere I took to heart, alas! no more to me * Is<br />
           friend; and even Luna's self displayeth lunacy:<br />
      You left and by your going left the world a waste, a wolf, * And<br />
           lies a gloomy murk upon the face of hill and lea:<br />
      O may the raven-bird whose cry our hapless parting croaked *<br />
           Find ne'er a nesty home and eke shed all his plumery!<br />
      At length my patience fails me; and this absence wastes my<br />
          flesh; * How many a veil by severance rent our eyes are<br />
          doomed see:<br />
      Ah! shall I ever sight again our fair past nights of your; * And<br />
           shall a single house become a home for me once more?"<br /></p>
    <p>Then he wept with exceeding weeping and night came upon him; so he leant his head against his father's grave and
      sleep overcame him: Glory to him who sleepeth not! He ceased not slumbering till the moon rose, when his head
      slipped from off the tomb and he lay on his back, with limbs outstretched, his face shining bright in the
      moonlight. Now the cemetery was haunted day and night by Jinns who were of the True Believers, and presently came
      out a Jinniyah who, seeing Hasan asleep, marvelled at his beauty and loveliness and cried, "Glory to God! This
      youth can be none other than one of the Wuldan of Paradise. Then she flew firmament-wards to circle it, as was her
      custom, and met an Ifrit on the wing who saluted her and she said to him, "Whence comest thou?" "From Cairo," he
      replied. "Wilt thou come with me and look upon the beauty of a youth who sleepeth in yonder burial place?" she
      asked and he answered, "I will." So they flew till they lighted at the tomb and she showed him the youth and said,
      "Now diddest thou ever in thy born days see aught like this?" The Ifrit looked upon him and exclaimed, "Praise be
      to Him that hath no equal! But, O my sister, shall I tell thee what I have seen this day?" Asked she, "What is
      that?" and he answered, "I have seen the counterpart of this youth in the land of Egypt. She is the daughter of
      the Wazir Shams al-Din and she is a model of beauty and loveliness, of fairest favour and formous form, and dight
      with symmetry and perfect grace. When she had reached the age of nineteen, the Sultan of Egypt heard of her and,
      sending for the Wazir her father, said to him, 'Hear me, O Wazir: it hath reached mine ear that thou hast a
      daughter and I wish to demand her of thee in marriage." The Wazir replied, "O our lord the Sultan, deign accept my
      excuses and take compassion on my sorrows, for thou knowest that my brother, who was partner with me in the
      Wazirate, disappeared from amongst us many years ago and we wot not where he is. Now the cause of his departure
      was that one night, as we were sitting together and talking of wives and children to come, we had words on the
      matter and he went off in high dudgeon. But I swore that I would marry my daughter to none save to the son of my
      brother on the day her mother gave her birth, which was nigh upon nineteen years ago. I have lately heard that my
      brother died at Bassorah, where he married the daughter of the Wazir and that she bare him a son; and I will not
      marry my daughter but to him in honour of my brother's memory. I recorded the date of my marriage and the
      conception of my wife and the birth of my daughter; and from her horoscope I find that her name is conjoined with
      that of her cousin; and there are damsels in foison for our lord the Sultan.' The King, hearing his Minister's
      answer and refusal, waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and cried, 'When the like of me asketh a girl in marriage of
      the like of thee, he conferreth an honour, and thou rejectest me and puttest me off with cold excuses! Now, by the
      life of my head I will marry her to the meanest of my men in spite of the nose of thee! There was in the palace a
      horse-groom which was a Gobbo with a bunch to his breast and a hunch to his back; and the Sultan sent for him and
      married him to the daughter of the Wazir, lief or loath, and hath ordered a pompous marriage procession for him
      and that he go in to his bride this very night. I have now just flown hither from Cairo, where I left the
      Hunchback at the door of the Hammam-bath amidst the Sultan's white slaves who were waving lighted flambeaux about
      him. As for the Minister's daughter she sitteth among her nurses and tirewomen, weeping and wailing; for they have
      forbidden her father to come near her. Never have I seen, O my sister, more hideous being than this Hunchback
      whilest the young lady is the likest of all folk to this young man, albeit even fairer than he,"—And Shahrazad
      perceived the dawn of day and ceased her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Twenty-second Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Jinni narrated to the Jinniyah how the King had
      caused the wedding contract to be drawn up between the hunchbacked groom and the lovely young lady who was
      heart-broken for sorrow; and how she was the fairest of created things and even more beautiful than this youth,
      the Jinniyah cried at him "Thou liest! this youth is handsomer than any one of his day." The Ifrit gave her the
      lie again, adding, "By Allah, O my sister, the damsel I speak of is fairer than this; yet none but he deserveth
      her, for they resemble each other like brother and sister or at least cousins. And, well-away! how she is wasted
      upon that Hunchback!" Then said she, "O my brother, let us get under him and lift him up and carry him to Cairo,
      that we may compare him with the damsel of whom thou speakest and so determine whether of the twain is the
      fairer." "To hear is to obey!" replied he, "thou speakest to the point; nor is there a righter recking than this
      of thine, and I myself will carry him." So he raised him from the ground and flew with him like a bird soaring in
      upper air, the Ifritah keeping close by his side at equal speed, till he alighted with him in the city of Cairo
      and set him down on a stone bench and woke him up. He roused himself and finding that he was no longer at his
      father's tomb in Bassorah-city he looked right and left and saw that he was in a strange place; and he would have
      cried out; but the Ifrit gave him a cuff which persuaded him to keep silence. Then he brought him rich raiment and
      clothed him therein and, giving him a lighted flambeau, said, "Know that I have brought thee hither, meaning to do
      thee a good turn for the love of Allah: so take this torch and mingle with the people at the Hammam-door and walk
      on with them without stopping till thou reach the house of the wedding-festival; then go boldly forward and enter
      the great saloon; and fear none, but take thy stand at the right hand of the Hunchback bridegroom; and, as often
      as any of the nurses and tirewomen and singing-girls come up to thee, put thy hand into thy pocket which thou wilt
      find filled with gold. Take it out and throw it to them and spare not; for as often as thou thrustest fingers in
      pouch thou shalt find it full of coin. Give largesse by handsful and fear nothing, but set thy trust upon Him who
      created thee, for this is not by thine own strength but by that of Allah Almighty, that His decrees may take
      effect upon his creatures." When Badr al-Din Hasan heard these words from the Ifrit he said to himself, "Would
      Heaven I knew what all this means and what is the cause of such kindness!" However, he mingled with the people
      and, lighting his flambeau, moved on with the bridal procession till he came to the bath where he found the
      Hunchback already on horseback. Then he pushed his way in among the crowd, a veritable beauty of a man in the
      finest apparel, wearing tarbush and turband and a long-sleeved robe purfled with gold; and, as often as the
      singing-women stopped for the people to give them largesse, he thrust his hand into his pocket and, finding it
      full of gold, took out a handful and threw it on the tambourine till he had filled it with gold pieces for the
      music-girls and the tirewomen. The singers were amazed by his bounty and the people marvelled at his beauty and
      loveliness and the splendour of his dress. He ceased not to do thus till he reached the mansion of the Wazir (who
      was his uncle), where the Chamberlains drove back the people and forbade them to go forward; but the singing-girls
      and the tirewomen said, "By Allah we will not enter unless this young man enter with us, for he hath given us
      length o' life with his largesse and we will not display the bride unless he be present." Therewith they carried
      him into the bridal hall and made him sit down defying the evil glances of the hunchbacked bridegroom. The wives
      of the Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Courtiers all stood in double line, each holding a massy cierge ready
      lighted; all wore thin face-veils and the two rows right and left extended from the bride's throne to the head of
      the hall adjoining the chamber whence she was to come forth. When the ladies saw Badr al-Din Hasan and noted his
      beauty and loveliness and his face that shone like the new moon, their hearts inclined to him and the
      singing-girls said to all that were present, "Know that this beauty crossed our hands with naught but red gold; so
      be not chary to do him womanly service and comply with all he says, no matter what he ask. So all the women
      crowded around Hasan with their torches and gazed upon his loveliness and envied him his beauty; and one and all
      would gladly have lain on his bosom an hour or rather a year. Their hearts were so troubled that they let fall
      their veils from before their faces and said, "Happy she who belongeth to this youth or to whom he belongeth!";
      and they called down curses on the crooked groom and on him who was the cause of his marriage to the girl-beauty;
      and as often as they blessed Badr al-Din Hasan they damned the Hunchback, saying, "Verily this youth and none else
      deserveth our Bride: Ah, well-away for such a lovely one with this hideous Quasimodo; Allah's curse light on his
      head and on the Sultan who commanded the marriage!" Then the singing- girls beat their tabrets and lulliloo'd with
      joy, announcing the appearing of the bride; and the Wazir's daughter came in surrounded by her tirewomen who had
      made her goodly to look upon; for they had perfumed her and incensed her and adorned her hair; and they had robed
      her in raiment and ornaments befitting the mighty Chosroes Kings. The most notable part of her dress was a loose
      robe worn over her other garments; it was diapered in red gold with figures of wild beasts, and birds whose eyes
      and beaks were of gems, and claws of red rubies and green beryl; and her neck was graced with a necklace of Yamani
      work, worth thousands of gold pieces, whose bezels were great round jewels of sorts, the like of which was never
      owned by Kaysar or by Tobba King. And the bride was as the full moon when at fullest on fourteenth night; and as
      she paced into the hall she was like one of the Houris of Heaven—praise be to Him who created her in such
      splendour of beauty! The ladies encompassed her as the white contains the black of the eye, they clustering like
      stars whilst she shone amongst them like the moon when it eats up the clouds. Now Badr al-Din Hasan of Bassorah
      was sitting in full gaze of the folk, when the bride came forward with her graceful swaying and swimming gait, and
      her hunchbacked groom stood up to meet and receive her: she, however, turned away from the wight and walked
      forward till she stood before her cousin Hasan, the son of her uncle. Whereat the people laughed. But when the
      wedding-guests saw her thus attracted towards Badr al-Din they made a mighty clamour and the singing-women shouted
      their loudest; whereupon he put his hand into his pocket and, pulling out a handful of gold, cast it into their
      tambourines and the girls rejoiced and said, "Could we win our wish this bride were thine!" At this he smiled and
      the folk came round him, flambeaux in hand like the eyeball round the pupil, while the Gobbo bridegroom was left
      sitting alone much like a tail-less baboon; for every time they lighted a candle for him it went out willy- nilly,
      so he was left in darkness and silence and looking at naught but himself. When Badr al-Din Hasan saw the
      bridegroom sitting lonesome in the dark, and all the wedding- guests with their flambeaux and wax candles crowding
      around himself, he was bewildered and marvelled much; but when he looked at his cousin, the daughter of his uncle,
      he rejoiced and felt an inward delight: he longed to greet her and gazed intently on her face which was radiant
      with light and brilliancy. Then the tirewomen took off her veil and displayed her in the first bridal dress which
      was of scarlet satin; and Hasan had a view of her which dazzled his sight and dazed his wits, as she moved to and
      fro, swaying with graceful gait; and she turned the heads of all the guests, women as well as men, for she was
      even as saith the surpassing poet:—</p>
    <p>A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed * Clad in her<br />
           cramoisy-hued chemisette:<br />
      Of her lips honey-dew she gave me drink, * And with her rosy<br />
           cheeks quencht fire she set.<br /></p>
    <p>Then they changed that dress and displayed her in a robe of azure; and she reappeared like the full moon when it
      riseth over the horizon, with her coal-black hair and cheeks delicately fair; and teeth shown in sweet smiling and
      breasts firm rising and crowning sides of the softest and waist of the roundest. And in this second suit she was
      as a certain master of high conceits saith of the like of her:—</p>
    <p>She came apparrelled in an azure vest, * Ultramarine, as skies<br />
           are deckt and dight;<br />
      I view'd th' unparrellel'd sight, which show'd my eyes * A moon<br />
           of Summer on a Winter-night.<br /></p>
    <p>Then they changed that suit for another and, veiling her face in the luxuriance of her hair, loosed her
      lovelocks, so dark, so long that their darkness and length outvied the darkest nights, and she shot through all
      hearts with the magical shaft of her eye-babes. They displayed her in the third dress and she was as said of her
      the sayer:—</p>
    <p>Veiling her cheeks with hair a-morn she comes, * And I her<br />
           mischiefs with the cloud compare:<br />
      Saying, "Thou veilest morn with night!" "Ah, no!" * Quoth she,<br />
           "I shroud full moon with darkling air!"<br /></p>
    <p>Then they displayed her in the fourth bridal dress and she came forward shining like the rising sun and swaying
      to and fro with lovesome grace and supple ease like a gazelle-fawn. And she clave all hearts with the arrows of
      her eyelashes, even as saith one who described a charmer like her:—</p>
    <p>The sun of beauty she to sight appears * And, lovely-coy, she<br />
           mocks all loveliness;<br />
      And when he fronts her favour and her smile * A-morn, the Sun of<br />
           day in clouds must dress.<br /></p>
    <p>Then she came forth in the fifth dress, a very light of loveliness like a wand of waving willow or a gazelle of
      the thirsty wold. Those locks which stung like scorpions along her cheeks were bent, and her neck was bowed in
      blandishment, and her hips quivered as she went. As saith one of the poets describing her in verse:—</p>
    <p>She comes like fullest moon on happy night; * Taper of waist,<br />
           with shape of magic might:<br />
      She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind, * And Ruby on her<br />
           cheeks reflects his light:<br />
      Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair; *Beware of curls that<br />
           bite with viper-bite!<br />
      Her sides are silken-soft, the while the heart * Mere rock behind<br />
           that surface lurks from sight:<br />
      From the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots * Shafts which<br />
           at farthest range on mark alight:<br />
      When round her neck or waist I throw my arms * Her breasts repel<br />
           me with their hardened height.<br />
      Ah, how her beauty all excels! ah how * That shape transcends the<br />
           graceful waving bough!<br /></p>
    <p>Then they adorned her with the sixth toilette, a dress which was green. And now she shamed her slender
      straightness the nut-brown spear; her radiant face dimmed the brightest beams of full moon and she outdid the
      bending branches in gentle movement and flexible grace. Her loveliness exalted the beauties of earth's four
      quarters and she broke men's hearts by the significance of her semblance; for she was even as saith one of the
      poets in these lines:—</p>
    <p>A damsel 'twas the tirer's art had decked with snares and<br />
           sleight. * And robed in rays as though the sun from<br />
           her had borrowed light:<br />
      She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green, * As<br />
           veiled by its leafy screen pomegranate hides from sight:<br />
      And when he said "How callest thou the manner of thy dress?" *<br />
           She answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight;<br />
      "We call this garment creve-coeur; and rightly is it hight, * For<br />
           many a heart wi' this we broke and conquered many<br />
           a sprite!"<br /></p>
    <p>Then they displayed her in the seventh dress, coloured between safflower and saffron, even as one of the poets
      saith:—</p>
    <p>In vest of saffron pale and safflower red * Musk'd, sandal'd<br />
           ambergris'd, she came to front:<br />
      "Rise!" cried her youth, "go forth and show thyself!" * "Sit!"<br />
           said her hips, "we cannot bear the brunt!"<br />
      And when I craved a bout, her Beauty said * "Do, do!" and said<br />
           her pretty shame, "Don't, don't!"<br /></p>
    <p>Thus they displayed the bride in all her seven toilettes before Hasan al-Basri, wholly neglecting the Gobbo who
      sat moping alone; and, when she opened her eyes she said, "O Allah make this man my goodman and deliver me from
      the evil of this hunchbacked groom." As soon as they had made an end of this part of the ceremony they dismissed
      the wedding guests who went forth, women, children and all, and none remained save Hasan and the Hunchback, whilst
      the tirewomen led the bride into an inner room to change her garb and gear and get her ready for the bridegroom.
      Thereupon Quasimodo came up to Badr al-Din Hasan and said, "O my lord, thou hast cheered us this night with thy
      good company and overwhelmed us with thy kindness and courtesy; but now why not get thee up and go?" "Bismallah,"
      he answered, "In Allah's name so be it!" and rising, he went forth by the door, where the Ifrit met him and said,
      "Stay in thy stead, O Badr al-Din, and when the Hunchback goes out to the closet of ease go in without losing time
      and seat thyself in the alcove; and when the bride comes say to her, "'Tis I am thy husband, for the King devised
      this trick only fearing for thee the evil eye, and he whom thou sawest is but a Syce, a groom, one of our
      stablemen.' Then walk boldly up to her and unveil her face; for jealousy hath taken us of this matter." While
      Hasan was still talking with the Ifrit behold, the groom fared forth from the hall and entering the closet of ease
      sat down on the stool. Hardly had he done this when the Ifrit came out of the tank, wherein the water was, in
      semblance of a mouse and squeaked out "Zeek!" Quoth the Hunchback, "What ails thee?"; and the mouse grew and grew
      till it became a coal-black cat and caterwauled "Meeao! Meeao!" Then it grew still more and more till it became a
      dog and barked out "Owh! Owh!" When the bridegroom saw this he was frightened and exclaimed "Out with thee, O
      unlucky one!" But the dog grew and swelled till it became an ass-colt that brayed and snorted in his face "Hauk!
      Hauk!" Whereupon the Hunchback quaked and cried, "Come to my aid, O people of the house!" But behold, the ass-colt
      grew and became big as a buffalo and walled the way before him and spake with the voice of the sons of Adam,
      saying, "Woe to thee, O thou Bunch-back, thou stinkard, O thou filthiest of grooms!" Hearing this the groom was
      seized with a colic and he sat down on the jakes in his clothes with teeth chattering and knocking together. Quoth
      the Ifrit, "Is the world so strait to thee thou findest none to marry save my lady-love?" But as he was silent the
      Ifrit continued, "Answer me or I will do thee dwell in the dust!" "By Allah," replied the Gobbo, "O King of the
      Buffaloes, this is no fault of mine, for they forced me to wed her; and verily I wot not that she had a lover
      among the buffaloes; but now I repent, first before Allah and then before thee." Said the Ifrit to him, "I swear
      to thee that if thou fare forth from this place, or thou utter a word before sunrise, I assuredly will wring thy
      neck. When the sun rises wend thy went and never more return to this house." So saying, the Ifrit took up the
      Gobbo bridegroom and set him head downwards and feet upwards in the slit of the privy, and said to him, "I will
      leave thee here but I shall be on the look-out for thee till sunrise; and, if thou stir before then, I will seize
      thee by the feet and dash out thy brains against the wall: so look out for thy life!" Thus far concerning the
      Hunchback, but as regards Badr al-Din Hasan of Bassorah he left the Gobbo and the Ifrit jangling and wrangling
      and, going into the house, sat him down in the very middle of the alcove; and behold, in came the bride attended
      by an old woman who stood at the door and said, "O Father of Uprightness, arise and take what God giveth thee."
      Then the old woman went away and the bride, Sitt al-Husn or the Lady of Beauty hight, entered the inner part of
      the alcove broken-hearted and saying in herself, "By Allah I will never yield my person to him; no, not even were
      he to take my life!" But as she came to the further end she saw Badr al-Din Hasan and she said, "Dearling! Art
      thou still sitting here? By Allah I was wishing that thou wert my bridegroom or, at least, that thou and the
      hunchbacked horse-groom were partners in me." He replied, "O beautiful lady, how should the Syce have access to
      thee, and how should he share in thee with me?" "Then," quoth she, "who is my husband, thou or he?" "Sitt al-
      Husn," rejoined Hasan, "we have not done this for mere fun, but only as a device to ward off the evil eye from
      thee; for when the tirewomen and singers and wedding guests saw they beauty being displayed to me, they feared
      fascination and thy father hired the horse-groom for ten dinars and a porringer of meat to take the evil eye off
      us; and now he hath received his hire and gone his gait." When the Lady of Beauty heard these words she smiled and
      rejoiced and laughed a pleasant laugh. Then she whispered him, "By the Lord thou hast quenched a fire which
      tortured me and now, by Allah, O my little dark-haired darling, take me to thee and press me to thy bosom!" Then
      she began singing:—</p>
    <p>"By Allah, set thy foot upon my soul; * Since long, long years<br />
           for this alone I long:<br />
      And whisper tale of love in ear of me; * To me 'tis sweeter than<br />
           the sweetest song!<br />
      No other youth upon my heart shall lie; * So do it often, dear,<br />
           and do it long."<br /></p>
    <p>Then she stripped off her outer gear and she threw open her chemise from the neck downwards and showed her parts
      genital and all the rondure of her hips. When Badr al-Din saw the glorious sight his desires were roused, and he
      arose and doffed her clothes, and wrapping up in his bag-trousers the purse of gold which he had taken from the
      Jew and which contained the thousand dinars, he laid it under the edge of the bedding. Then he took off his
      turband and set it upon the settle atop of his other clothes, remaining in his skull-cap and fine shirt of blue
      silk laced with gold. Whereupon the Lady of Beauty drew him to her and he did likewise. Then he took her to his
      embrace and set her legs round his waist and point-blanked that cannon placed where it battereth down the bulwark
      of maidenhead and layeth it waste. And he found her a pearl unpierced and unthridden and a filly by all men save
      himself unridden; and he abated her virginity and had joyance of her youth in his virility and presently he
      withdrew sword from sheath; and then returned to the fray right eath; and when the battle and the siege had
      finished, some fifteen assaults he had furnished and she conceived by him that very night. Then he laid his hand
      under her head and she did the same and they embraced and fell asleep in each other's arms, as a certain poet said
      of such lovers in these couplets:—</p>
    <p>Visit thy lover, spurn what envy told; * No envious churl shall<br />
           smile on love ensoul'd.<br />
      Merciful Allah made no fairer sight * Than coupled lovers single<br />
           couch doth hold;<br />
      Breast pressing breast and robed in joys their own, * With<br />
           pillowed forearms cast in finest mould:<br />
      And when heart speaks to heart with tongue of love, * Folk who<br />
           would part them hammer steel ice-cold:<br />
      If a fair friend thou find who cleaves to thee, * Live<br />
           for that friend, that friend in heart enfold.<br />
      O ye who blame for love us lover kind * Say, can ye minister to<br />
           diseasèd mind?<br /></p>
    <p>This much concerning Badr al-Hasan and Sitt al-Husn his cousin; but as regards the Ifrit, as soon as he saw the
      twain asleep, he said to the Ifritah, "Arise, slip thee under the youth and let us carry him back to his place ere
      dawn overtake us; for the day is nearhand." Thereupon she came forward and, getting under him as he lay asleep,
      took him up clad only in his fine blue shirt, leaving the rest of his garments; and ceased not flying (and the
      Ifrit vying with her in flight) till the dawn advised them that it had come upon them mid-way, and the Muezzin
      began his call from the Minaret, "Haste ye to salvation! Haste ye to salvation!" Then Allah suffered his angelic
      host to shoot down the Ifrit with a shooting star, so he was consumed, but the Ifritah escaped and she descended
      with Badr al- Din at the place where the Ifrit was burnt, and did not carry him back to Bassorah, fearing lest he
      come to harm. Now by the order of Him who predestineth all things, they alighted at Damascus of Syria, and the
      Ifritah set down her burden at one of the city- gates and flew away. When day arose and the doors were opened, the
      folks who came forth saw a handsome youth, with no other raiment but his blue shirt of gold-embroidered silk and
      skull- cap, lying upon the ground drowned in sleep after the hard labour of the night which had not suffered him
      to take his rest. So the folk looking at him said, "O her luck with whom this one spent the night! but would he
      had waited to don his garments." Quoth another, "A sorry lot are the sons of great families! Haply he but now came
      forth of the tavern on some occasion of his own and his wine flew to his head, whereby he hath missed the place he
      was making for and strayed till he came to the gate of the city; and finding it shut lay him down and to by-by!"
      As the people were bandying guesses about him suddenly the morning breeze blew upon Badr al-Din and raising his
      shirt to his middle showed a stomach and navel with something below it, and legs and thighs clear as crystal and
      smooth as cream. Cried the people, "By Allah he is a pretty fellow!"; and at the cry Badr al-din awoke and found
      himself lying at a city-gate with a crowd gathered around him. At this he greatly marvelled and asked, "Where am
      I, O good folk; and what causeth you thus to gather round me, and what have I had to do with you?"; and they
      answered, "We found thee lying here asleep during the call to dawn-prayer and this is all we know of the matter,
      but where diddest thou lie last night?" "By Allah, O good people," replied he, "I lay last night in Cairo." Said
      somebody, "Thou hast surely been eating Hashish," and another, "He is a fool;" and a third, "He is a citrouille;"
      and a fourth asked him, "Art thou out of thy mind? thou sleepest in Cairo and thou wakest in the morning at the
      gate of Damascus- city!" Cried he, "By Allah, my good people, one and all, I lie not to you: indeed I lay
      yesternight in the land of Egypt and yesternoon I was at Bassorah." Quoth one, "Well! well!"; and quoth another,
      "Ho! ho!"; and a third, "So! so!"; and a fourth cried, "This youth is mad, is possessed of the Jinni!" So they
      clapped hands at him and said to one another, "Alas, the pity of it for his youth: by Allah a madman! and madness
      is no respecter of persons." Then they said to him, "Collect thy wits and return to thy reason! How couldest thou
      be in Bassorah yesterday and Cairo yesternight and withal awake in Damascus this morning?" But he persisted,
      "Indeed I was a bridegroom in Cairo last night." "Belike thou hast been dreaming," rejoined they, "and sawest all
      this in thy sleep." So Hasan took thought for a while and said to them, "By Allah, this is no dream; nor vision-
      like doth it seem! I certainly was in Cairo where they displayed the bride before me, in presence of a third
      person, the Hunchback groom who was sitting hard by. By Allah, O my brother, this be no dream, and if it were a
      dream, where is the bag of gold I bore with me and where are my turband and my robe, and my trousers?" Then he
      rose and entered the city, threading its highways and by- ways and bazar-streets; and the people pressed upon him
      and jeered at him, crying out "Madman! madman!" till he, beside himself with rage, took refuge in a cook's shop.
      Now that Cook had been a trifle too clever, that is, a rogue and thief; but Allah had made him repent and turn
      from his evil ways and open a cook-shop; and all the people of Damascus stood in fear of his boldness and his
      mischief. So when the crowd saw the youth enter his shop, they dispersed being afraid of him, and went their ways.
      The Cook looked at Badr al-Din and, noting his beauty and loveliness, fell in love with him forthright and said,
      "Whence comest thou, O youth? Tell me at once thy tale, for thou art become dearer to me than my soul." So Hasan
      recounted to him all that had befallen him from beginning to end (but in repetition there is no fruition) and the
      Cook said, "O my lord Badr al-Din, doubtless thou knowest that this case is wondrous and this story marvellous;
      therefore, O my son, hide what hath betided thee, till Allah dispel what ills be thine; and tarry with me here the
      meanwhile, for I have no child and I will adopt thee." Badr al- Din replied, "Be it as thou wilt, O my uncle!"
      Whereupon the Cook went to the bazar and bought him a fine suit of clothes and made him don it; then fared with
      him to the Kazi, and formally declared that he was his son. So Badr al-Din Hasan became known in Damascus-city as
      the Cook's son and he sat with him in the shop to take the silver, and on this wise he sojourned there for a time.
      Thus far concerning him; but as regards his cousin, the Lady of Beauty, when morning dawned she awoke and missed
      Badr al- Din Hasan from her side; but she thought that he had gone to the privy and she sat expecting him for an
      hour or so; when behold, entered her father Shams al-Din Mohammed, Wazir of Egypt. Now he was disconsolate by
      reason of what had befallen him through the Sultan, who had entreated him harshly and had married his daughter by
      force to the lowest of his menials and he too a lump of a groom bunch-backed withal, and he said to himself, "I
      will slay this daughter of mine if of her own free will she have yielded her person to this acursed carle." So he
      came to the door of the bride's private chamber and said, "Ho! Sitt al- Husn." She answered him, "Here am I! here
      am I!" O my lord," and came out unsteady of gait after the pains and pleasures of the night; and she kissed his
      hand, her face showing redoubled brightness and beauty for having lain in the arms of that gazelle, her cousin.
      When her father, the Wazir, saw her in such case, he asked her, "O thou accursed, art thou rejoicing because of
      this horse-groom?", and Sitt al-Husn smiled sweetly and answered, "By Allah, don't ridicule me: enough of what
      passed yesterday when folk laughed at me, and evened me with that groom- fellow who is not worthy to bring my
      husband's shoes or slippers; nay who is not worth the paring of my husband's nails! By the Lord, never in my life
      have I nighted a night so sweet as yesternight!, so don't mock by reminding me of the Gobbo." When her parent
      heard her words he was filled with fury, and his eyes glared and stared, so that little of them showed save the
      whites and he cried, "Fie upon thee! What words are these? 'Twas the hunchbacked horse-groom who passed the night
      with thee!" "Allah upon thee," replied the Lady of Beauty, "do not worry me about the Gobbo, Allah damn his
      father; and leave jesting with me; for this groom was only hired for ten dinars and a porringer of meat and he
      took his wage and went his way. As for me I entered the bridal-chamber, where I found my true bridegroom sitting,
      after the singer-women had displayed me to him; the same who had crossed their hands with red gold, till every
      pauper that was present waxed wealthy; and I passed the night on the breast of my bonny man, a most lively
      darling, with his black eyes and joined eyebrows." When her parent heard these words the light before his face
      became night, and he cried out at her saying, "O thou whore! What is this thou tellest me? Where be thy wits?" "O
      my father," she rejoined, "thou breakest my heart; enough for thee that thou hast been so hard upon me! Indeed my
      husband who took my virginity is but just now gone to the draught-house and I feel that I have conceived by him."
      The Wazir rose in much marvel and entered the privy where he found the hunchbacked groom with his head in the
      hole, and his heels in the air. At this sight he was confounded and said, "This is none other than he, the rascal
      Hunchback!" So he called to him, "Ho Hunchback!" The Gobbo grunted out, "Taghum! Taghum!" thinking it was the
      Ifrit spoke to him; so the Wazir shouted at him and said, "Speak out, or I'll strike off thy pate with this
      sword." Then quoth the Hunchback, "By Allah, O Shaykh of the Ifrits, ever since thou settest me in this place, I
      have not lifted my head; so Allah upon thee, take pity and entreat me kindly!" When the Wazir heard this he asked,
      "What is this thou sayest? I'm bride's father and no Ifrit." "Enough for thee that thou hast well nigh done me
      die, " answered Quasimodo; "now go thy ways before he come upon thee who hath served me thus. Could ye not marry
      me to any save the lady-love of buffaloes and the beloved of Ifrits? Allah curse her and curse him who married me
      to her and was the cause of this my case,"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her
      permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Twenty-third Night,</p>
    <p>Said she, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the hunchbacked groom spake to the bride's father saying,
      "Allah curse him who was the cause of this my case!" Then said the Wazir to him, "Up and out of this place!" "Am I
      mad," cried the groom, "that I should go with thee without leave of the Ifrit whose last words to me were:—"When
      the sun rises, arise and go they gait." So hath the sun risen or no?; for I dare not budge from this place till
      then." Asked the Wazir, "Who brought thee hither?"; and he answered "I came here yesternight for a call of nature
      and to do what none can do for me, when lo! a mouse came out of the water, and squeaked at me and swelled and
      waxed gross till it was big as a buffalo, and spoke to me words that entered my ears. Then he left me here and
      went away, Allah curse the bride and him who married me to her!" The Wazir walked up to him and lifted his head
      out of the cesspool hole; and he fared forth running for dear life and hardly crediting that the sun had risen;
      and repaired to the Sultan to whom he told all that had befallen him with the Ifrit. But the Wazir returned to the
      bride's private chamber, sore troubled in spirit about her, and said to her, "O my daughter, explain this strange
      matter to me!" Quoth she, "Tis simply this. The bridegroom to whom they displayed me yestereve lay with me all
      night, and took my virginity and I am with child by him. He is my husband and if thou believe me not, there are
      his turband, twisted as it was, lying on the settle and his dagger and his trousers beneath the bed with a
      something, I wot not what, wrapped up in them." When her father heard this he entered the private chamber and
      found the turband which had been left there by Badr al-Din Hasan, his brother's son, and he took it in hand and
      turned it over, saying, "This is the turband worn by Wazirs, save that it is of Mosul stuff." So he opened it and,
      finding what seemed to be an amulet sewn up in the Fez, he unsewed the lining and took it out; then he lifted up
      the trousers wherein was the purse of the thousand gold pieces and, opening that also, found in it a written
      paper. This he read and it was the sale-receipt of the Jew in the name of Badr al-Din Hasan, son of Nur al-Din
      Ali, the Egyptian; and the thousand dinars were also there. No sooner had Shams al-Din read this than he cried out
      with a loud cry and fell to the ground fainting; and as soon as he revived and understood the gist of the matter
      he marvelled and said, "There is no God, but the God, who All-might is over all things! Knowest thou, O my
      daughter, who it was that became the husband of thy virginity?" "No," answered she, and he said, "Verily he is the
      son of my brother, thy cousin, and this thousand dinars is thy dowry. Praise be to Allah! and would I wot how this
      matter came about!" then opened he the amulet which was sewn up and found therein a paper in the handwriting of
      his deceased brother, Nur al-Din the Egyptian, father of Badr al-Din Hasan; and, when he saw the hand-writing, he
      kissed it again and again; and he wept and wailed over his dead brother and improvised this lines:—</p>
    <p>"I see their traces and with pain I melt, * And on their whilome<br />
           homes I weep and yearn:<br />
      And Him I pray who dealt this parting-blow * Some day he deign<br />
           vouchsafe a safe return." <br /></p>
    <p>When he ceased versifying, he read the scroll and found in it recorded the dates of his brother's marriage with
      the daughter of the Wazir of Bassorah, and of his going in to her, and her conception, and the birth of Badr
      al-Din Hasan and all his brother's history and doings up to his dying day. So he marvelled much and shook with joy
      and, comparing the dates with his own marriage and going in to his wife and the birth of their daughter, Sitt
      al-Husn, he found that they perfectly agreed. So he took the document and, repairing with it to the Sultan,
      acquainted him with what had passed, from first to last; whereat the King marvelled and commanded the case to be
      at once recorded. The Wazir abode that day expecting to see his brother's son but he came not; and he waited a
      second day, a third day and so on to the seventh day, without any tidings of him. So he said, "By Allah, I will do
      a deed such as none hath ever done before me!"; and he took reed-pen and ink and drew upon a sheet of paper the
      plan of the whole house, showing whereabouts was the private chamber with the curtain in such a place and the
      furniture in such another and so on with all that was in the room. Then he folded up the sketch and, causing all
      the furniture to be collected, he took Badr al-Din's garments and the turband and Fez and robe and purse, and
      carried the whole to his house and locked them up, against the coming of his nephew, Badr al-Din Hasan, the son of
      his lost brother, with an iron padlock on which he set his seal. As for the Wazir's daughter, when her tale of
      months was fulfilled, she bare a son like the full moon, the image of his father in beauty and loveliness and fair
      proportions and perfect grace. They cut his navel-string and Kohl'd his eyelids to strengthen his eyes, and gave
      him over to the nurses and nursery governesses, naming him Ajib, the Wonderful. His day was as a month and his
      month was as a year; and, when seven years had passed over him, his grandfather sent him to school, enjoining the
      master to teach him Koran-reading, and to educate him well. he remained at the school four years, till he began to
      bully his schoolfellows and abuse them and bash them and thrash them and say, "Who among you is like me? I am the
      son of Wazir of Egypt!" At last the boys came in a body to the Monitor of what hard usage they were wont to have
      from Ajib, and he said to them, "I will tell you somewhat you may do to him so that he shall leave off coming to
      the school, and it is this. When he enters to-morrow, sit ye down about him and say some one of you to some other,
      'By Allah none shall play with us at this game except he tell us the names of his mamma and his papa; for he who
      knows not the names of his mother and his father is a bastard, a son of adultery, and he shall not play with us.'"
      When morning dawned the boys came to school, Ajib being one of them, and all flocked around him saying, "We will
      play a game wherein none can join save he can tell the name of his mamma and his papa." And they all cried, "By
      Allah, good!" Then quoth one of them, "My name is Majid and my mammy's name is Alawiyah and my daddy's Izz
      al-Din." Another spoke in like guise and yet a third, till Ajid's turn came, and he said, "MY name is Ajib, and my
      mother's is Sitt al- Husn, and my father's Shams al-Din, the Wazir of Cairo." "By Allah," cried they, "the Wazir
      is not thy true father." Ajib answered, "The Wazir is my father in very deed." Then the boys all laughed and
      clapped their hands at him, saying "He does not know who is his papa: get out from among us, for none shall play
      with us except he know his father's name." Thereupon they dispersed from around him and laughed him to scorn; so
      his breast was straitened and he well nigh choked with tears and hurt feelings. Then said the Monitor to him, "We
      know that the Wazir is thy grandfather, the father of thy mother, Sitt al-Husn, and not thy father. As for thy
      father, neither dost thou know him nor yet do we; for the Sultan married thy mother to the hunchbacked
      horse-groom; but the Jinni came and slept with her and thou hast no known father. Leave, then, comparing thyself
      too advantageously with the little ones of the school, till thou know that thou hast a lawful father; for until
      then thou wilt pass for a child of adultery amongst them. Seest thou that not even a huckster's son knoweth his
      own sire? Thy grandfather is the Wazir of Egypt; but as for thy father we wot him not and we say indeed that thou
      hast none. So return to thy sound senses!" When Ajib heard these insulting words from the Monitor and the school
      boys and understood the reproach they put upon him, he went out at once and ran to his mother, Sitt al-Husn, to
      complain; but he was crying so bitterly that his tears prevented his speech for a while. When she heard his sobs
      and saw his tears her heart burned as though with fire for him, and she said, "O my son, why dost thou weep? Allah
      keep the tears from thine eyes! Tell me what hath betided thee?" So he told her all that he heard from the boys
      and from the Monitor and ended with asking, "And who, O my mother, is my father?" She answered, "Thy father is the
      Wazir of Egypt;" but he said, "Do not lie to me. The Wazir is thy father, not mine! who then is my father? Except
      thou tell me the very truth I will kill myself with this hanger." When his mother heard him speak of his father
      she wept, remembering her cousin and her bridal night with him and all that occurred thereon and then, and she
      repeated these couplets:—</p>

    <p>"Love in my heart they lit and went their ways, * And all I<br />
           love to furthest lands withdrew;<br />
      And when they left me sufferance also left, * And when we parted<br />
           Patience bade adieu:<br />
      They fled and flying with my joys they fled, * In very<br />
           consistency my spirit flew:<br />
      They made my eyelids flow with severance tears * And to the<br />
           parting-pang these drops are due:<br />
      And when I long to see reunion-day, * My groans prolonging sore<br />
           for ruth I sue:<br />
      Then in my heart of hearts their shapes I trace, * And love and<br />
           longing care and cark renew:<br />
      O ye, whose names cling round me like a cloak, * Whose love yet<br />
           closer than a shirt I drew,<br />
      Beloved ones! how long this hard despite? * How long this<br />
           severance and this coy shy flight?"<br /></p>
    <p>Then she wailed and shrieked aloud and her son did the like; and behold, in came the Wazir whose heart burnt
      within him at the sight of their lamentations, and he said, "What makes you weep?" So the Lady of Beauty
      acquainted him with what had happened between her son and the school boys; and he also wept, calling to mind his
      brother and what had past between them and what had betided his daughter and how he had failed to find out what
      mystery there was in the matter. Then he rose at once and, repairing to the audience-hall, went straight to the
      King and told his tale and craved his permission to travel eastward to the city of Bassorah and ask after his
      brother's son. Furthermore, he besought the Sultan to write for him letters patent, authorising him to seize upon
      Badr al-Din, his nephew and son-in-law, wheresoever he might find him. And he wept before the King, who had pity
      on him and wrote royal autographs to his deputies in all climes and countries and cities; whereat the Wazir
      rejoiced and prayed for blessings on him. Then, taking leave of his Sovereign, he returned to his house, where he
      equipped himself and his daughter and his adopted child Ajib, with all things meet for a long march; and set out
      and travelled the first day and the second and the third and so forth till he arrived at Damascus-city. He found
      it a fair place abounding in trees and streams, even as the poet said of it:—</p>
    <p>When I nighted and dayed in Damascus town, * Time sware such<br />
           another he ne'er should view:<br />
      And careless we slept under wing of night, * Till dappled Morn<br />
           'gan her smiles renew:<br />
      And dew-drops on branch in their beauty hung, * Like pearls to be<br />
           dropt when the Zephyr blew:<br />
      And the Lake was the page where birds read and note, *<br />
           And the clouds set points to what breezes wrote.<br /></p>
    <p>The Wazir encamped on the open space called Al-Hasa; and, after pitching tents, said to his servants, "A halt
      here for two days!" So they went into the city upon their several occasions, this to sell and this to buy; this to
      go to the Hammam and that to visit the Cathedral-mosque of the Banu Umayyah, the Ommiades, whose like is not in
      this world. Ajib also went, with his attendant eunuch, for solace and diversion to the city and the servant
      followed with a quarter-staff of almond-wood so heavy that if he struck a camel therewith the beast would never
      rise again. When the people of Damascus saw Ajib's beauty and brilliancy and perfect grace and symmetry (for he
      was a marvel of comeliness and winning loveliness, softer than the cool breeze of the North, sweeter than limpid
      waters to a man in drowth, and pleasanter than the health for which sick man sueth), a mighty many followed him,
      whilest others ran on before, and sat down on the road until he should come up, that they might gaze on him, till,
      as Destiny had decreed, the Eunuch stopped opposite the shop of Ajib's father, Badr al-Din Hasan. Now his beard
      had grown long and thick and his wits had ripened during the twelve years which had passed over him, and the Cook
      and ex-rogue having died, the so-called Hasan of Bassorah had succeeded to his goods and shop, for that he had
      been formally adopted before the Kazi and witnesses. When his son and the Eunuch stepped before him he gazed on
      Ajib and, seeing how very beautiful he was, his heart fluttered and throbbed, and blood drew to blood and natural
      affection spake out and his bowels yearned over him. He had just dressed a conserve of pomegranate-grains with
      sugar, and Heaven-implanted love wrought within him; so he called to his son Ajib and said, "O my lord, O thou who
      hast gotten the mastery of my heart and my very vitals and to whom my bowels yearn; say me, wilt thou enter my
      house and solace my soul by eating of my meat?" Then his eyes streamed with tears which he could not stay, for he
      bethought him of what he had been and what he had become. When Ajib heard his father's words his heart also
      yearned himwards and he looked at the Eunuch and said to him, "Of a truth, O my good guard, my heart yearns to
      this cook; he is as one that hath a son far away from him: so let us enter and gladden his heart by tasting of his
      hospitality. Perchance for our so doing Allah may reunite me with my father." When the Eunuch heard these words he
      cried, "A fine thing this, by Allah! Shall the sons of Wazirs be seen eating in a common cook-shop? Indeed I keep
      off the folk from thee with this quarter-staff lest they even look upon thee; and I dare not suffer thee to enter
      this shop at all." When Hasan of Bassorah heard his speech he marvelled and turned to the Eunuch with the tears
      pouring down his cheeks; and Ajib said, "Verily my heart loves him!" But he answered, "Leave this talk, thou shalt
      not go in." Thereupon the father turned to the Eunuch and said, "O worthy sir, why wilt thou not gladden my soul
      by entering my shop? O thou who art like a chestnut, dark without but white of heart within! O thou of the like of
      whom a certain poet said * * *" The Eunuch burst out a-laughing and asked—"Said what? Speak out by Allah and be
      quick about it." So Hasan the Bassorite began reciting these couplets:—</p>
    <p>"If not master of manners or aught but discreet * In the<br />
           household of Kings no trust could he take:<br />
      And then for the Harem! what Eunuch is he * Whom<br />
           angels would serve for his service sake."<br /></p>
    <p>The Eunuch marvelled and was pleased at these words, so he took Ajib by the hand and went into the cook's shop:
      whereupon Hasan the Bassorite ladled into a saucer some conserve of pomegranate- grains wonderfully good, dressed
      with almonds and sugar, saying, "You have honoured me with your company: eat then and health and happiness to
      you!" Thereupon Ajib said to his father, "Sit thee down and eat with us; so perchance Allah may unite us with him
      we long for." Quoth Hasan, "O my son, hast thou then been afflicted in thy tender years with parting from those
      thou lovest?" Quoth Ajib, "Even so, O nuncle mine; my heart burns for the loss of a beloved one who is non other
      than my father; and indeed I come forth, I and my grandfather, to circle and search the world for him. Oh, the
      pity of it, and how I long to meet him!" Then he wept with exceeding for his own bereavement, which recalled to
      him his long separation from dear friends and from his mother; and the Eunuch was moved to pity for him. Then they
      ate together till they were satisfied; and Ajib and the slave rose and left the shop. Hereat Hasan the Bassorite
      felt as though his soul had departed his body and had gone with them; for he could not lose sight of the boy
      during the twinkling of an eye, albeit he knew not that Ajib was his son. So he locked up his shop and hastened
      after them; and he walked so fast that he came up with them before they had gone out of the western gate. The
      Eunuch turned and asked him, "What ails the?"; and Badr al- Din answered, "When ye went from me, meseemed my soul
      had gone with you; and, as I had business without the city-gate, I purposed to bear you company till my matter was
      ordered and so return." The Eunuch was angered and said to Ajib, "This is just what I feared! we ate that unlucky
      mouthful (which we are bound to respect), and here is the fellow following us from place to place; for the vulgar
      are ever the vulgar." Ajib, turning and seeing the Cook just behind him, was wroth and his face reddened with rage
      and he said to the servant; "Let him walk the highway of the Moslems; but, when we turn off it to our tents, and
      find that he still follows us, we will send him about his business with a flea in his ear." Then he bowed his head
      and walked on, the Eunuch walking behind him. But Hasan of Bassorah followed them to the plain Al-Hasa; and, as
      they drew near to the tents, they turned round and saw him close on their heels; so Ajib was very angry, fearing
      that the Eunuch might tell his grandfather what had happened. His indignation was the hotter for apprehension lest
      any say that after he had entered a cook-shop the cook had followed him. So he turned and looked at Hasan of
      Bassorah and found his eyes fixed on his own, for the father had become a body without a soul; and it seemed to
      Ajib that his eye was a treacherous eye or that he was some lewd fellow. So his rage redoubled and, stooping down,
      he took up a stone weighing half a pound and threw it at his father. It struck him on the forehead, cutting it
      open from eye-brow to eye-brow and causing the blood to stream down: and Hasan fell to the ground in a swoon
      whilst Ajib and the Eunuch made for the tents. When the father came to himself he wiped away the blood and tore
      off a strip from his turband and bound up his head, blaming himself the while, and saying, "I wronged the lad by
      shutting up my shop and following, so that he thought I was some evil-minded fellow." Then he returned to his
      place where he busied himself with the sale of his sweetmeats; and he yearned after his mother at Bassorah, and
      wept over her and broke out repeating:—</p>
    <p>"Unjust it were to bid the World be just * And blame<br />
           her not: She ne'er was made for justice:<br />
      Take what she gives thee, leave all grief aside, * For now to<br />
           fair and then to foul her lust is."<br /></p>
    <p>So Hasan of Bassorah set himself steadily to sell his sweetmeats; but the Wazir, his uncle, halted in Damascus
      three days and then marched upon Emesa, and passing through that town he made enquiry there and at every place
      where he rested. Thence he fared on by way of Hamah and Aleppo and thence to Diyar Bakr and Maridin and Mosul,
      still enquiring, till he arrived at Bassorah-city. Here, as soon as he had secured a lodging, he presented himself
      before the Sultan, who entreated him with high honour and the respect due to his rank, and asked the cause of his
      coming. The Wazir acquainted him with his history and told him that the Minister Nur al-Din was his brother;
      whereupon the Sultan exclaimed, "Allah have mercy upon him!" and added, "My good Sahib!" ; he was my Wazir for
      fifteen years and I loved him exceedingly. Then he died leaving a son who abode only a single month after his
      father's death; since which time he has disappeared and we could gain no tidings of him. But his mother, who is
      the daughter of my former Minister, is still among us." When the Wazir Shams al-Din heard that his nephew's mother
      was alive and well, he rejoiced and said, "O King I much desire to meet her." The King on the instant gave him
      leave to visit her; so he betook himself to the mansion of his brother, Nur al-Din, and cast sorrowful glances on
      all things in and around it and kissed the threshold. Then he bethought him of his brother, Nur al-Din Ali, and
      how he had died in a strange land far from kith and kin and friends; and he wept and repeated these lines:—</p>
    <p>"I wander 'mid these walls, my Layla's walls, * And kissing this<br />
           and other wall I roam:<br />
      'Tis not the walls or roof my heart so loves, * But those who in<br />
           this house had made their home."<br /></p>
    <p>Then he passed through the gate into a courtyard and found a vaulted doorway builded of hardest syenite inlaid
      with sundry kinds of multi-coloured marble. Into this he walked and wandered about the house and, throwing many a
      glance around, saw the name of his brother, Nur al-Din, written in gold wash upon the walls. So he went up to the
      inscription and kissed it and wept and thought of how he had been separated from his brother and had now lost him
      for ever, and he recited these couplets:—</p>
    <p>"I ask of you from every rising sun, * And eke I ask when<br />
           flasheth levenlight:<br />
      When I pass my nights in passion-pain, * Yet ne'er I 'plain me<br />
           of my painful plight;<br />
      My love! if longer last this parting throe * Little by little<br />
           shall it waste my sprite.<br />
      An thou wouldst bless these eyne with sight of thee * One day on<br />
           earth, I crave none other sight:<br />
      Think not another could possess my mind * Nor length nor breadth<br />
           for other love I find."<br /></p>
    <p>Then he walked on till he came to the apartment of his brother's widow, the mother of Badr al-Din Hasan, the
      Egyptian. Now from the time of her son's disappearance she had never ceased weeping and wailing through the light
      hours and the dark; and, when the years grew longsome with her, she built for him a tomb of marble in the midst of
      the saloon and there used to weep for him day and night, never sleeping save thereby. When the Wazir drew near her
      apartment, he heard her voice and stood behind the door while she addressed the sepulchre in verse and said:—</p>
    <p>"Answer, by Allah! Sepulchre, are all his beauties gone? * Hath<br />
           change the power to blight his charms, that Beauty's<br />
           paragon?<br />
      Thou art not earth, O Sepulchre! nor art thou sky to me; * How<br />
           comes it, then, in thee I see conjoint the branch and moon?"<br /></p>
    <p>While she was bemoaning herself after this fashion, behold, the Wazir went in to her and saluted her and informed
      her that he was her husband's brother; and, telling her all that had passed between them, laid open before her the
      whole story, how her son Badr al-Din Hasan had spent a whole night with his daughter full ten years ago but had
      disappeared in the morning. And he ended with saying, "My daughter conceived by thy son and bare a male child who
      is now with me, and he is thy son and thy son's son by my daughter." When she heard the tidings that her boy, Badr
      al- Din, was still alive and saw her brother-in-law, she rose up to him and threw herself at his feet and kissed
      them, reciting these lines:—</p>
    <p>"Allah be good to him that gives glad tidings of thy steps; * In<br />
           very sooth for better news mine ears would never sue:<br />
      Were he content with worn-out robe, upon his back I'd throw * A<br />
           heart to pieces rent and torn when heard the word Adieu."<br /></p>
    <p>Then the Wazir sent for Ajib and his grandmother stood up and fell on his neck and wept; but Shams al-Din said to
      her, "This is no time for weeping; this is the time to get thee ready for travelling with us to the land of Egypt;
      haply Allah will reunite me and thee with thy son and my nephew." Replied she, "Hearkening and obedience;" and,
      rising at once, collected her baggage and treasures and her jewels, and equipped herself and her slave-girls for
      the march, whilst the Wazir went to take his leave of the Sultan of Bassorah, who sent by him presents and
      rarities for the Soldan of Egypt. Then he set out at once upon his homeward march and journeyed till he came to
      Damascus-city where he alighted in the usual place and pitched tents, and said to his suite, "We will halt a
      se'nnight here to buy presents and rare things for the Soldan." Now Ajib bethought him of the past so he said to
      the Eunuch, "O Laik, I want a little diversion; come, let us go down to the great bazar of Damascus, and see what
      hath become of the cook whose sweetmeats we ate and whose head we broke, for indeed he was kind to us and we
      entreated him scurvily." The Eunuch answered, "Hearing is obeying!" So they went forth from the tents; and the tie
      of blood drew Ajib towards his father, and forthwith they passed through the gateway, Bab al-Faradis hight, and
      entered the city and ceased not walking through the streets till they reached the cookshop, where they found Hasan
      of Bassorah standing at the door. It was near the time of mid-afternoon prayer and it so fortuned that he had just
      dressed a confection of pomegranate-grains. When the twain drew near to him and Ajib saw him, his heart yearned
      towards him, and noticing the scar of the blow, which time had darkened on his brow, he said to him, "Peace be on
      thee, O man!" know that my heart is with thee." But when Badr al-Din looked upon his son his vitals yearned and
      his heart fluttered, and he hung his head earthwards and sought to make his tongue give utterance to his words,
      but he could not. Then he raised his head humbly and suppliant-wise towards his boy and repeated these couplets:—
    </p>
    <p>"I longed for my beloved but when I saw his face, * Abashed I<br />
           held my tongue and stood with downcast eye;<br />
      And hung my head in dread and would have hid my love, * But do<br />
           whatso I would hidden it would not lie;<br />
      Volumes of plaints I had prepared, reproach and blame, * But<br />
           when we met, no single word remembered I."<br /></p>
    <p>And then said he to them, "Heal my broken heart and eat of my sweetmeats; for, by Allah, I cannot look at thee
      but my heart flutters. Indeed I should not have followed thee the other day, but that I was beside myself." "By
      Allah," answered Ajib, "thou dost indeed love us! We ate in thy house a mouthful when we were here before and thou
      madest us repent of it, for that thou followedst us and wouldst have disgraced us; so now we will not eat aught
      with thee save on condition that thou make oath not to go out after us nor dog us. Otherwise we will not visit
      thee again during our present stay; for we shall halt a week here, whilst my grandfather buys certain presents for
      the King." Quoth Hasan of Bassorah, "I promise you this." So Ajib and the Eunuch entered the shop, and his father
      set before them a saucer-full of conserve of pomegranate-grains. Said Ajib, "Sit thee down and eat with us, so
      haply shall Allah dispel our sorrows." Hasan the Bassorite was joyful and sat down and ate with them; but his eyes
      kept gazing fixedly on Ajib's face, for his very heart and vitals clove to him; and at last the boy said to him,
      "Did I not tell thee thou art a most noyous dotard?; so do stint thy staring in my face!" But when Hasan of
      Bassorah heard his son's words he repeated these lines:—</p>
    <p>"Thou hast some art the hearts of men to clip; * Close-veiled,<br />
           far-hidden mystery dark and deep:<br />
      O thou whose beauties sham the lustrous moon, * Wherewith the<br />
           saffron Morn fears rivalship!<br />
      Thy beauty is a shrine shall ne'er decay; * Whose signs shall<br />
           grow until they all outstrip; <br />
      Must I be thirst-burnt by that Eden-brow * And die of pine to<br />
           taste that Kausar-lip?" <br /></p>
    <p>Hasan kept putting morsels into Ajib's mouth at one time and at another time did the same by the Eunuch and they
      ate till they were satisfied and could no more. Then all rose up and the cook poured water on their hands; and,
      loosing a silken waist-shawl, dried them and sprinkled them with rose-water from a casting-bottle he had by him.
      Then he went out and presently returned with a gugglet of sherbet flavoured with rose-water, scented with musk and
      cooled with snow; and he set this before them saying, "Complete your kindness to me!" So Ajib took the gugglet and
      drank and passed it to the Eunuch; and it went round till their stomachs were full and they were surfeited with a
      meal larger than their wont. Then they went away and made haste in walking till they reached the tents, and Ajib
      went in to his grandmother, who kissed him and, thinking of her son, Badr al-Din Hasan, groaned aloud and wept and
      recited these lines:—</p>
    <p>"I still had hoped to see thee and enjoy thy sight, * For in<br />
           thine absence life has lost its kindly light:<br />
      I swear my vitals wot none other love but thine * By Allah, who<br />
           can read the secrets of the sprite!"<br /></p>
    <p>Then she asked Ajib, "O my son! where hast thou been?"; and he answered, "In Damascus-city;" Whereupon she rose
      and set before him a bit of scone and a saucer of conserve of pomegranate-grains (which was too little sweetened),
      and she said to the Eunuch, "Sit down with thy master!" Said the servant to himself, "By Allah, we have no mind to
      eat: I cannot bear the smell of bread;" but he sat down and so did Ajib, though his stomach was full of what he
      had eaten already and drunken. Nevertheless he took a bit of the bread and dipped it in the pomegranate-conserve
      and made shift to eat it, but he found it too little sweetened, for he was cloyed and surfeited, so he said,
      "Faugh; what be this wild-beast stuff?" "O my son," cried his grandmother, "dost thou find fault with my cookery?
      I cooked this myself and none can cook it as nicely as I can save thy father, Badr al-Din Hasan." "By Allah, O my
      lady, Ajib answered, "this dish is nasty stuff; for we saw but now in the city of Bassorah a cook who so dresseth
      pomegranate-grains that the very smell openeth a way to the heart and the taste would make a full man long to eat;
      and, as for this mess compared with his, 'tis not worth either much or little." When his grandmother heard his
      words she waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and looked at the servant—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
      ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Twenty-fourth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ajib's grandmother heard his words, she waxed wroth
      and looked at the servant and said, "Woe to thee! dost thou spoil my son, and dost take him into common
      cookshops?" The Eunuch was frightened and denied, saying, "We did not go into the shop; we only passed by it." "By
      Allah," cried Ajib, "but we did go in and we ate till it came out of our nostrils, and the dish was better than
      thy dish!" Then his grandmother rose and went and told her brother-in-law, who was incensed against the Eunuch,
      and sending for him asked him, "Why didst thou take my son into a cookshop?"; and the Eunuch being frightened
      answered, "We did not go in." But Ajib said, "We did go inside and ate conserve of pomegranate-grains till we were
      full; and the cook gave us to drink of iced and sugared sherbet." At this the Wazir's indignation redoubled and he
      questioned the Castrato but, as he still denied, the Wazir said to him, "If thou speak sooth, sit down and eat
      before us." So he came forward and tried to eat, but could not eat and threw away the mouthful crying "O my lord!
      I am surfeited since yesterday." By this the Wazir was certified that he had eaten at the cook's and bade the
      slaves throw him which they did. Then they came down on him with a rib- basting which burned him till he cried for
      mercy and help from Allah, saying, "O my master, beat me no more and I will tell thee the truth;" whereupon the
      Wazir stopped the bastinado and said, "Now speak thou sooth." Quoth the Eunuch, "Know then that we did enter the
      shop of a cook while he was dressing conserve of pomegranate-grains and he set some of it before us: by Allah! I
      never ate in my life its like, nor tasted aught nastier than this stuff which is now before us." Badr al-Din
      Hasan's mother was angry at this and said, "Needs thou must go back to the cook and bring me a saucer of conserved
      pomegranate-grains from that which is in his shop and show it to thy master, that he may say which be the better
      and the nicer, mine or his." Said the unsexed, "I will." So on the instant she gave him a saucer and a half dinar
      and he returned to the shop and said to the cook, "O Shaykh of all Cooks, we have laid a wager concerning thy
      cookery in my lord's house, for they have conserve of pomegranate-grains there also; so give me this half-dinar's
      worth and look to it; for I have eaten a full meal of stick on account of thy cookery, and so do not let me eat
      aught more thereof." Hasan of Bassorah laughed and answered, "By Allah, none can dress this dish as it should be
      dressed save myself and my mother, and she at this time is in a far country." Then he ladled out a saucer-full;
      and, finishing it off with musk and rose-water, put it in a cloth which he sealed and gave it to the Eunuch, who
      hastened back with it. No sooner had Badr al-Din Hasan's mother tasted it and perceived its fine flavour and the
      excellence of the cookery, than she knew who had dressed it, and she screamed and fell down fainting. The Wazir,
      sorely started, sprinkled rose-water upon her and after a time she recovered and said, "If my son be yet of this
      world, none dressed this conserve of pomegranate-grains but he; and this Cook is my very son Badr al-Din Hasan;
      there is no doubt of it nor can there be any mistake, for only I and he knew how to prepare it and I taught him."
      When the Wazir heard her words he joyed with exceeding joy and said, "O the longing of me for a sight of my
      brother's son! I wonder if the days will ever unite us with him! Yet it is to Almighty Allah alone that we look
      for bringing about this meeting." Then he rose without stay or delay and, going to his suite said to them, "Be
      off, some fifty of you with sticks and staves to the Cook's shop and demolish it; then pinion his arms behind him
      with his own turband, saying, 'It was thou madest that foul mess of pomegranate-grains!' and drag him here
      perforce but without doing him a harm." And they replied, "It is well." Then the Wazir rode off without losing an
      instant to the Palace and, foregathering with the Viceroy of Damascus, showed him the Sultan's orders. After
      careful perusal he kissed the letter, and placing it upon his head said to his visitor, "Who is this offender of
      thine?" Quoth the Wazir, "A man who is a cook." So the Viceroy at once sent his apparitors to the shop; which they
      found demolished and everything in it broken to pieces; for whilst the Wazir was riding to the palace his men had
      done his bidding. Then they awaited his return from the audience, and Hasan of Bassorah who was their prisoner
      kept saying, "I wonder what they have found in the conserve of pomegranate-grains to bring things to this pass!"
      When the Wazir returned to them, after his visit to the Viceroy who had given him formal permission to take up his
      debtor and depart with him, on entering the tents he called for the Cook. They brought him forward pinioned with
      his turband; and, when Badr al-Din Hasan saw his uncle, he wept with excessive weeping and said, "O my lord, what
      is my offence against thee?" "Art thou the man who dressed that conserve of pomegranate-grains?"; asked the Wazir,
      and he answered "Yes! didst thou find in it aught to call for the cutting off of my head?" Quoth the Wazir, "That
      were the least of thy deserts!" Quoth the cook, "O my lord, wilt thou not tell me my crime and what aileth the
      conserve of pomegranate-grains?" "Presently," replied the Wazir and called aloud to his men, "Bring hither the
      camels." So they struck the tents and by the Wazir's orders the servants took Badr al-Din Hasan, and set him in a
      chest which they padlocked and put on a camel. Then they departed and stinted not journeying till nightfall, when
      they halted and ate some victual, and took Badr al-Din Hasan out of his chest and gave him a meal and locked him
      up again. They set out once more and travelled till they reached Kimrah, where they took him out of the box and
      brought him before the Wazir who asked him, "Art thou he who dressed that conserve of pomegranate- grains?" He
      answered "Yes, O my lord!"; and the Wazir said "Fetter him!" So they fettered him and returned him to the chest
      and fared on again till they reached Cairo and lighted at the quarter called Al-Raydaniyah. Then the Wazir gave
      order to take Badr al-Din Hasan out of the chest and sent for a carpenter and said to him, "Make me a cross of
      wood for this fellow!" Cried Badr al-Din Hasan "And what wilt thou do with it?"; and the Wazir replied, "I mean to
      crucify thee thereon, and nail thee thereto and parade thee all about the city." "And why wilt thou use me after
      this fashion?" "Because of thy villanous cookery of conserved pomegranate-grains; how durst thou dress it and sell
      it lacking pepper?" "And for that it lacked pepper wilt thou do all this to me? Is it not enough that thou hast
      broken my shop and smashed my gear and boxed me up in a chest and fed me only once a day?" "Too little pepper! too
      little pepper! this is a crime which can be expiated only upon the cross!" Then Badr al-Din Hasan marvelled and
      fell a-mourning for his life; whereupon the Wazir asked him, "Of what thinkest thou?"; and he answered him, "Of
      maggoty heads like thine; for an thou had one ounce of sense thou hadst not treated me thus." Quoth the Wazir, "It
      is our duty to punish thee lest thou do the like again." Quoth Badr al-Din Hasan, "Of a truth my offense were
      over-punished by the least of what thou hast already done to me; and Allah damn all conserve of pomegranate-grains
      and curse the hour when I cooked it and would I had died ere this!" But the Wazir rejoined, "There is no help for
      it; I must crucify a man who sells conserve of pomegranate-grains lacking pepper." All this time the carpenter was
      shaping the wood and Badr al-Din looked on; and thus they did till night, when his uncle took him and clapped him
      into the chest, saying, "The thing shall be done to-morrow!" Then he waited until he knew Badr al-Din "Hasan to be
      asleep, when he mounted; and taking the chest up before him, entered the city and rode on to his own house, where
      he alighted and said to his daughter, Sitt al-Husn, "Praised be Allah who hath reunited thee with thy husband, the
      son of thine uncle! Up now, and order the house as it was on thy bridal night." So the servants arose and lit the
      candles; and the Wazir took out his plan of the nuptial chamber, and directed them what to do till they had set
      everything in its stead, so that whoever saw it would have no doubt but it was the very night of the marriage.
      Then he bade them put down Badr al-Din Hasan's turband on the settle, as he had deposited it with his own hand,
      and in like manner his bag-trousers and the purse which were under the mattress: and told daughter to undress
      herself and go to bed in the private chamber as on her wedding-night, adding, "When the son of thine uncle comes
      in to thee, say to him:—Thou hast loitered while going to the privy; and call him to lie by thy side and keep him
      in converse till daybreak, when we will explain the whole matter to him." Then he bade take Badr al-Din Hasan out
      of the chest, after loosing the fetters from his feet and stripping off all that was on him save the fine shirt of
      blue silk in which he had slept on his wedding-night; so that he was well-nigh naked and trouserless. All this was
      done whilst he was sleeping on utterly unconscious. Then, by doom of Destiny, Badr al-Din Hasan turned over and
      awoke; and, finding himself in a lighted vestibule, said to himself, "Surely I am in the mazes of some dream." So
      he rose and went on to a little to an inner door and looked in and lo! he was in the very chamber wherein the
      bride had been displayed to him; and there he saw the bridal alcove and the settle and his turband and all his
      clothes. When he saw this he was confounded and kept advancing with one foot, and retiring with the other, saying,
      "Am I sleeping or waking?" And he began rubbing his forehead and saying (for indeed he was thoroughly astounded),
      "By Allah, verily this is the chamber of the bride who was displayed before me! Where am I then? I was surely but
      now in a box!" Whilst he was talking with himself, Sitt al-Husn suddenly lifted the corner of the chamber-curtain
      and said, "O my lord, wilt thou not come in? Indeed thou hast loitered long in the water-closet." When he heard
      her words and saw her face he burst out laughing and said, "Of a truth this is a very nightmare among dreams!"
      Then he went in sighing, and pondered what had come to pass with him and was perplexed about his case, and his
      affair became yet more obscure to him when he saw his turband and bag-trousers and when, feeling the pocket, he
      found the purse containing the thousand gold pieces. So he stood still and muttered, "Allah is all knowing!
      Assuredly I am dreaming a wild waking dream!" Then said the Lady of Beauty to him, "What ails thee to look puzzled
      and perplexed?"; adding, "Thou wast a very different man during the first of the night!" He laughed and asked her,
      "How long have I been away from thee?"; and she answered him, "Allah preserve thee and His Holy Name be about
      thee! Thou didst but go out an hour ago for an occasion and return. Are thy wits clean gone?" When Badr al-Din
      Hasan heard this, he laughed, and said, "Thou hast spoken truth; but, when I went out from thee, I forgot myself
      awhile in the draught-house and dreamed that I was a cook at Damascus and abode there ten years; and there came to
      me a boy who was of the sons of the great, and with him an Eunuch." Here he passed his hand over his forehead and,
      feeling the scar, cried, "By Allah, O my lady, it must have been true, for he struck my forehead with a stone and
      cut it open from eye-brow to eye-brow; and here is the mark: so it must have been on wake." Then he added, "But
      perhaps I dreamt it when we fell asleep, I and thou, in each other's arms, for meseems it was as though I
      travelled to Damascus without tarbush and trousers and set up as a cook there." Then he was perplexed and
      considered for awhile, and said, "By Allah, I also fancied that I dressed a conserve of pomegranate-grains and put
      too little pepper in it. By Allah, I must have slept in the numerocent and have seen the whole thing in a dream;
      but how long was that dream!" "Allah upon thee," said Sitt al-Husn, "and what more sawest thou?" So he related all
      to her; and presently said, "By Allah had I not woke up they would have nailed me to a cross of wood!"
      "Wherefore?" asked she; and he answered, "For putting too little pepper in the conserve of pomegranate-grains, and
      meseemed they demolished my shop and dashed to pieces my pots and pans, destroyed all my stuff and put me in a
      box; they then sent for the carpenter to fashion a cross for me and would have crucified me thereon. Now
      Alham-dolillah! thanks be to Allah, for that all this happened to me in sleep, and not on wake." Sitt al-Husn
      laughed and clasped him to her bosom and he her to his: then he thought again and said, "By Allah, it could not be
      save while I was awake: truly I know not what to think of it." Then he lay him down and all the night he was
      bewildered about his case, now saying, "I was dreaming!" and then saying, "I was awake!", till morning, when his
      uncle Shams al-Din, the Wazir, came to him and saluted him. When Badr al-Din Hasan saw him he said, "By Allah, art
      thou not he who bade bind my hands behind me and smash my shop and nail me to a cross on a matter of conserved
      pomegranate-grains because the dish lacked a sufficiency of pepper?" Whereupon the Wazir said to him, "Know, O my
      son, that truth hath shown it soothfast and the concealed hath been revealed! Thou art the son of my brother, and
      I did all this with thee to certify myself that thou wast indeed he who went in unto my daughter that night. I
      could not be sure of this, till I saw that thou knewest the chamber and thy turband and thy trousers and thy gold
      and the papers in thy writing and in that of thy father, my brother; for I had never seen thee afore that and knew
      thee not; and as to thy mother I have prevailed upon her to come with me from Bassorah." So saying, he threw
      himself on his nephew's breast and wept for joy; and Badr al-Din Hasan, hearing these words from his uncle,
      marvelled with exceeding marvel and fell on his neck and also shed tears for excess of delight. Then said the
      Wazir to him, "O my son, the sole cause of all this is what passed between me and thy sire;" and all that had
      occurred to part them. Lastly the Wazir sent for Ajib; and when his father saw him he cried, "And this is he who
      struck me with the stone!" Quoth the Wazir, "This is thy son!" And Badr al-Din Hasan threw himself upon his boy
      and began repeating:—</p>
    <p>"Long have I wept o'er severance ban and bane, * Long from mine<br />
           eyelids tear-rills rail and rain:<br />
      And vowed I if Time re-union bring * My tongue from name of<br />
           "Severance" I'll restrain:<br />
      Joy hath o'ercome me to this stress that I * From joy's revulsion<br />
           to shed tears am fain:<br />
      Ye are so trained to tears, O eyne of me! * You weep with<br />
           pleasure as you weep with pain." <br /></p>
    <p>When he had ended his verse his mother came in and threw herself upon him and began reciting:—</p>
    <p>"When we met we complained, * Our hearts were sore wrung:<br />
      But plaint is not pleasant * Fro' messenger's tongue."<br /></p>
    <p>Then she wept and related to him what had befallen her since his departure, and he told her what he had suffered,
      and they thanked Allah Almighty for their reunion. Two days after his arrival the Wazir Shams al-din went in to
      the Sultan and, kissing the ground between his hands, greeted him with the greeting due to Kings. The Sultan
      rejoiced at his return and his face brightened and, placing him hard by his side, asked him to relate all he had
      seen in his wayfaring and whatso had betided him in his going and coming. So the Wazir told him all that had
      passed from first to last and the Sultan said, "Thanks be to Allah for thy victory and the winning of thy wish and
      thy safe return to thy children and thy people! And now I needs must see the son of thy brother, Hasan of
      Bassorah, so bring him to the audience-hall to- morrow." Shams al-Din replied, "Thy slave shall stand in thy
      presence to-morrow, Inshallah, if it be God's will." Then he saluted him and, returning to his own house, informed
      his nephew of the Sultan's desire to see him, whereto replied Hasan, whilome the Bassorite, "The slave is obedient
      to the orders of his lord." And the result was that next day he accompanied his uncle, Shams al-Din, to the Divan;
      and, after saluting the Sultan and doing him reverence in most ceremonious obeisance and with most courtly
      obsequiousness, he began improvising these verses:—</p>
    <p>"The first in rank to kiss the ground shall deign * Before you,<br />
           and all ends and aims attain:<br />
      You are Honour's fount; and all that hope of you, * Shall gain<br />
           more honour than Hope hoped to gain."<br /></p>
    <p>The Sultan smiled and signed to him to sit down. So he took a seat close to his uncle, Shams al-Din, and the King
      asked him his name. Quoth Badr al-Din Hasan, "The meanest of thy slaves is known as Hasan the Bassorite, who is
      instant in prayer for thee day and night." The Sultan was pleased at his words and, being minded to test his
      learning and prove his good breeding, asked him, "Dost thou remember any verses in praise of the mole on the
      cheek?" He answered, "I do," and began reciting:—</p>
    <p>"When I think of my love and our parting-smart, * My groans go<br />
           forth and my tears upstart:<br />
      He's a mole that reminds me in colour and charms * O' the black<br />
           o' the eye and the grain of the heart."<br /></p>
    <p>The King admired and praised the two couplets and said to him, "Quote something else; Allah bless thy sire and
      may thy tongue never tire!" So he began:—</p>
    <p>"That cheek-mole's spot they evened with a grain * Of musk, nor<br />
           did they here the simile strain:<br />
      Nay, marvel at the face comprising all * Beauty, nor falling<br />
           short by single grain."<br /></p>
    <p>The King shook with pleasure and said to him, "Say more:<br />
      Allah bless thy days!" So he began:—<br /></p>
    <p>"O you whose mole on cheek enthroned recalls * A dot of musk<br />
           upon a stone of ruby,<br />
      Grant me your favours! Be not stone at heart! * Core of my heart<br />
           whose only sustenance you be!"<br /></p>
    <p>Quoth the King, "Fair comparison, O Hasan! thou hast spoken excellently well and hast proved thyself accomplished
      in every accomplishment! Now explain to me how many meanings be there in the Arabic language for the word Khal or
      mole." He replied, "Allah keep the King! Seven and fifty and some by tradition say fifty." Said the Sultan, "Thou
      sayest sooth," presently adding, "Hast thou knowledge as to the points of excellence in beauty?" "Yes," answered
      Badr al-Din Hasan, "Beauty consisteth in brightness of face, clearness of complexion, shapeliness of nose,
      gentleness of eyes, sweetness of mouth, cleverness of speech, slenderness of shape and seemliness of all
      attributes. But the acme of beauty is in the hair and, indeed, al-Shihab the Hijazi hath brought together all
      these items in his doggrel verse of the metre Rajaz, and it is this:</p>
    <p>Say thou to skin "Be soft," to face "Be fair," * And gaze, nor<br />
           shall they blame howso thou stare:<br />
      Fine nose in Beauty's list is high esteemed; * Nor less an eye<br />
           full, bright and debonnair:<br />
      Eke did they well to laud the lovely lips * (Which e'en the sleep<br />
           of me will never spare);<br />
      A winning tongue, a stature tall and straight; * A<br />
           seemly union of gifts rarest rare:<br />
      But Beauty's acme in the hair one views it; * So hear my strain<br />
           and with some few excuse it!"<br /></p>
    <p>The Sultan was captivated by his converse and, regarding him as a friend, asked, "What meaning is there in the
      saw 'Shurayh is foxier than the fox'?" And he answered, "Know, O King (whom Almighty Allah keep!) that the legist
      Shurayh was wont, during the days of the plague, to make a visitation to Al-Najaf; and, whenever he stood up to
      pray, there came a fox which would plant himself facing him and which, by mimicking his movements, distracted him
      from his devotions. Now when this became longsome to him, one day he doffed his shirt and set it upon a cane and
      shook out the sleeves; then placing his turband on the top and girding its middle with a shawl, he stuck it up in
      the place where he used to pray. Presently up trotted the fox according to his custom and stood over against the
      figure, whereupon Shurayh came behind him, and took him. Hence the sayer saith, 'Shurayh foxier than the fox.'"
      When the Sultan heard Badr al-Din Hasan's explanation he said to his uncle, Shams al-Din, "Truly this the son of
      thy brother is perfect in courtly breeding and I do not think that his like can be found in Cairo." At this Hasan
      arose and kissed the ground before him and sat down again as a Mameluke should sit before his master. When the
      Sultan had thus assured himself of his courtly breeding and bearing and his knowledge of the liberal arts and
      belles-lettres, he joyed with exceeding joy and invested him with a splendid robe of honour and promoted him to an
      office whereby he might better his condition. Then Badr al-Din Hasan arose and, kissing the ground before the
      King, wished him continuance of glory and asked leave to retire with his uncle, the Wazir Shams al-Din. The Sultan
      gave him leave and he issued forth and the two returned home, where food was set before them and they ate what
      Allah had given them. After finishing his meal Hasan repaired to the sitting-chamber of his wife, the Lady of
      Beauty, and told her what had past between him and the Sultan; whereupon quoth she, "He cannot fail to make thee a
      cup-companion and give thee largess in excess and load thee with favours and bounties; so shalt thou, by Allah's
      blessing, dispread, like the greater light, the rays of thy perfection wherever thou be, on shore or on sea." Said
      he to her, "I purpose to recite a Kasidah, an ode, in his praise, that he may redouble in affection for me." "Thou
      art right in thine intent," she answered, "so gather thy wits together and weigh thy words, and I shall surely see
      my husband favoured with his highest favour." Thereupon Hasan shut himself up and composed these couplets on a
      solid base and abounding in inner grace and copies them out in a hand-writing of the nicest taste. They are as
      follows:—</p>
    <p>Mine is a Chief who reached most haught estate, * Treading the<br />
           pathways of the good and great:<br />
      His justice makes all regions safe and sure, * And against<br />
           froward foes bars every gate:<br />
      Bold lion, hero, saint, e'en if you call * Seraph or Sovran<br />
            he with all may rate!<br />
      The poorest supplicant rich from him returns, * All words to<br />
           praise him were inadequate.<br />
      He to the day of peace is saffron Morn, * And murky Night in<br />
           furious warfare's bate.<br />
      Bow 'neath his gifts our necks, and by his deeds * As King of<br />
           freeborn souls he 'joys his state:<br />
      Allah increase for us his term of years, * And from his lot avert<br />
           all risks and fears!<br /></p>
    <p>When he had finished transcribing the lines, he despatched them, in charge of one of his uncle's slaves, to the
      Sultan, who perused them and his fancy was pleased; so he read them to those present and all praised them with the
      highest praise. Thereupon he sent for the writer to his sitting-chamber and said to him, "Thou art from this day
      forth my boon-companion and I appoint to thee a monthly solde of a thousand dirhams, over and above that I
      bestowed on thee aforetime." So Hasan rose and, kissing the ground before the King several times, prayed for the
      continuance of his greatness and glory and length of life and strength. Thus Badr al-Din Hasan the Bassorite waxed
      high in honour and his fame flew forth to many regions and he abode in all comfort and solace and delight of life
      with his uncle and his own folk till Death overtook him. When the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard this story from the
      mouth of his Wazir, Ja'afar the Barmecide, he marvelled much and said, "It behoves that these stories be written
      in letters of liquid gold." Then he set the slave at liberty and assigned to the youth who had slain his wife such
      a monthly stipend as sufficed to make his life easy; he also gave him a concubine from amongst his own slave-girls
      and the young man became one of his cup-companions. "Yet this story," (continued Shahrazad) "is in no wise
      stranger than the tale of the Tailor and the Hunchback and the Jew and the Reeve and the Nazarene, and what
      betided them." Quoth the King, "And what may that be?" So Shahrazad began, in these words,</p>
