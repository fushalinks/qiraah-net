    <h3><a id="chap28" />Tale of the Tailor.</h3>
    <p>Know, O King of the age, that most marvellous was that which befell me but yesterday, before I foregathered with
      the Hunch back. It so chanced that in the early day I was at the marriage feast of one of my companions, who had
      gotten together in his house some twenty of the handicraftsmen of this city, amongst them tailors and silk
      spinners and carpenters and others of the same kidney. As soon as the sun had risen, they set food before
      us that we might eat when behold, the master of the house entered, and with him a foreign youth and a well
      favoured of the people of Baghdad, wearing clothes as handsome as handsome could be; and he was of right comely
      presence save that he was lame of one leg. He came and saluted us and we stood up to receive him; but when he was
      about to sit down he espied amongst us a certain man which was a Barber; whereupon he refused to be seated and
      would have gone away. But we stopped him and our host also stayed him, making oath that he should not leave us and
      asked him, "What is the reason of thy coming in and going out again at once?"; whereto he answered, "By Allah, O
      my lord, do not hinder me; for the cause of my turning back is yon Barber of bad omen, yon black o'face,
      yon ne'er do well!" When the housemaster heard these words he marvelled with extreme marvel and said, "How cometh
      this young man, who haileth from Baghdad, to be so troubled and perplexed about this Barber?" Then we looked at
      the stranger and said, "Explain the cause of thine anger against the Barber." "O fair company," quoth the youth,
      "there befell me a strange adventure with this Barber in Baghdad (which is my native city); he was the cause of
      the breaking of my leg and of my lameness, and I have sworn never to sit in the same place with him, nor even
      tarry in any town where he happens to abide; and I have bidden adieu to Baghdad and travelled far from it and came
      to stay in this your city; yet I have hardly passed one night before I meet him again. But not another day shall
      go by ere I fare forth from here." Said we to him, "Allah upon thee, tell us the tale;" and the youth replied (the
      Barber changing colour from brown to yellow as he spoke): Know, O fair company, that my father was one of the
      chief merchants of Baghdad, and Almighty Allah had blessed him with no son but myself. When I grew up and reached
      man's estate, my father was received into the mercy of Allah (whose Name be exalted!) and left me money and
      eunuchs, servants and slaves; and I used to dress well and diet well. Now Allah had made me a hater of women kind
      and one day, as I was walking along a street in Baghdad, a party of females met me face to face in the footway; so
      I fled from them and, entering an alley which was no thoroughfare, sat down upon a stone bench at its other end. I
      had not sat there long before the latticed window of one of the houses opposite was thrown open, and there
      appeared at it a young lady, as she were the full moon at its fullest; never in my life saw I her like; and she
      began to water some flowers on the window sill. She turned right and left and, seeing me watching her,
      shut the window and went away. Thereupon fire was suddenly enkindled in my heart; my mind was possessed with her
      and my woman hate turned to woman love. I continued sitting there, lost to the world, till sunset when lo! the
      Kazi of the city came riding by with his slaves before him and his eunuchs behind him, and dismounting entered the
      house in which the damsel had appeared. By this I knew that he was her father; so I went home sorrowful and cast
      myself upon my carpet bed in grief. Then my handmaids flocked in and sat about me, unknowing what ailed me; but I
      addressed no speech to them, and they wept and wailed over me. Presently in came an old woman who looked at me and
      saw with a glance what was the matter with me: so she by my head spoke me fair, saying, "O my son, tell me all
      about it and I will be the means of thy union with her." So I related to her what had happened and she
      answered, "O my son, this one is the daughter of the Kazi of Baghdad who keepeth her in the closest seclusion; and
      the window where thou sawest her is her floor, whilst her father occupies the large saloon in the lower story. She
      is often there alone and I am wont to visit at the house; so thou shalt not win to her save through me. Now set
      thy wits to work and be of good cheer." With these words she went away and I took heart at what she said and my
      people rejoiced that day, seeing me rise in the morning safe and sound. By and by the old woman returned looking
      chopfallen, and said, "O my son, do not ask me how I fared with her! When I told her that, she cried at
      me, 'If thou hold not thy peace, O hag of ill omen, and leave not such talk, I will entreat thee as thou deservest
      and do thee die by the foulest of deaths.' But needs must I have at her a second time." When I heard this
      it added ailment to my ailment and the neighbours visited me and judged that I was not long for this world; but
      after some days, the old woman came to me and, putting her mouth close to my ear, whispered, "O my son; I claim
      from thee the gift of good news." With this my soul returned to me and I said, "Whatever thou wilt shall be
      thine." Thereupon she began, "Yesterday I went to the young lady who, seeing me broken in spirit and shedding
      tears from reddened eyes, asked me, 'O naunty mine, what ails thee, that I see thy breast so straitened?';
      and I answered her, weeping bitterly, 'O my lady, I am just come from the house of a youth who loves thee and who
      is about to die for sake of thee!' Quoth she (and her heart was softened), 'And who is this youth of whom thou
      speakest?'; and quoth I, 'He is to me as a son and the fruit of my vitals. He saw thee, some days ago, at the
      window watering thy flowers and espying thy face and wrists he fell in love at first sight. I let him know what
      happened to me the last time I was with thee, whereupon his ailment increased, he took to the pillow and he is
      naught now but a dead man, and no doubt what ever of it.' At this she turned pale and asked, 'All this for my
      sake?'; and I answered, 'Ay, by Allah! what wouldst thou have me do?' Said she, 'Go back to him and greet
      him for me and tell him that I am twice more heartsick than he is. And on Friday, before the hour of public
      prayer, bid him here to the house, and I will come down and open the door for him. Then I will carry him up to my
      chamber and foregather with him for a while, and let him depart before my father return from the Mosque.'" When I
      heard the old woman's words, all my sickness suddenly fell from me, my anguish ceased and my heart was comforted;
      I took off what clothes were on me and gave them to her and, as she turned to go, she said, "Keep a good heart!"
      "I have not a jot of sorrow left." I replied. My household and intimates rejoiced in my recovery and I abode thus
      till Friday, when behold, the old woman came in and asked me how I did, to which I answered that I was well and in
      good case. Then I donned my clothes and perfumed myself and sat down to await the congregation going in to
      prayers, that I might betake myself to her. But the old woman said to me, "Thou hast time and to spare: so thou
      wouldst do well to go to the Hammam and have thy hair shaven off (especially after thy ailment), so as not to show
      traces of sickness." "This were the best way," answered I, "I have just now bathed in hot water, but I will have
      my head shaved." Then I said to my page, "Go to the bazaar and bring me a barber, a discreet fellow and one not
      inclined to meddling or impertinent curiosity or likely to split my head with his excessive talk." The boy
      went out at once and brought back with him this wretched old man, this Shaykh of ill omen. When he came in he
      saluted me and I returned his salutation; then quoth he, "Of a truth I see thee thin of body;" and quoth I, "I
      have been ailing." He continued, "Allah drive far away from thee thy woe and thy sorrow and thy trouble and thy
      distress." "Allah grant thy prayer!" said I. He pursued, "All gladness to thee, O my master, for indeed recovery
      is come to thee. Dost thou wish to be polled or to be blooded? Indeed it was a tradition of Ibn Abbas
      (Allah accept of him!) that the Apostle said, 'Whoso cutteth his hair on a Friday, the Lord shall avert from him
      threescore and ten calamities;' and again is related of him also that he said, 'Cupping on a Friday keepeth from
      loss of sight and a host of diseases.'" "Leave this talk," I cried; "come, shave me my head at once for I can't
      stand it." So he rose and put forth his hand in most leisurely way and took out a kerchief and unfolded it, and
      lo! it contained an astrolabe with seven parallel plates mounted in silver. Then he went to the middle of
      the court and raised head and instrument towards the sun's rays and looked for a long while. When this was over,
      he came back and said to me, "Know that there have elapsed of this our day, which be Friday, and this Friday be
      the tenth of the month Safar in the six hundred and fifty- third year since the Hegira or Flight of the Apostle
      (on whom be the bestest of blessings and peace!) and the seven thousand three hundred and twentieth year of the
      era of Alexander, eight degrees and six minutes. Furthermore the ascendant of this our day is, according to the
      exactest science of computation, the planet Mars; and it so happeneth that Mercury is in conjunction with him,
      denoting an auspicious moment for hair cutting; and this also maketh manifest to me that thou desires union with a
      certain person and that your intercourse will not be propitious. But after this there occurreth a sign respecting
      a matter which will befall thee and whereof I will not speak." "O thou," cried I, "by Allah, thou weariest me and
      scatterest my wits and thy forecast is other than good; I sent for thee to poll my head and naught else: so up and
      shave me and prolong not thy speech." "By Allah," replied he, "if thou but knew what is about to befall thee, thou
      wouldst do nothing this day, and I counsel thee to act as I tell thee by computation of the constellations." "By
      Allah," said I, "never did I see a barber who excelled in judicial astrology save thyself: but I think and I know
      that thou art most prodigal of frivolous talk. I sent for thee only to shave my head, but thou comest and
      pesterest me with this sorry prattle." "What more wouldst thou have?" replied he. "Allah hath bounteously bestowed
      on thee a Barber who is an astrologer, one learned in alchemy and white magic; syntax, grammar, and
      lexicology; the arts of logic, rhetoric and elocution; mathematics, arithmetic and algebra; astronomy, astromancy
      and geometry; theology, the Traditions of the Apostle and the Commentaries on the Koran. Furthermore, I have read
      books galore and digested them and have had experience of affairs and comprehended them. In short I have learned
      the theorick and the practick of all the arts and sciences; I know everything of them by rote and I am a past
      master in tota re scibili. Thy father loved me for my lack of officiousness, argal, to serve thee is a religious
      duty incumbent on me. I am no busy body as thou seemest to suppose, and on this account I am known as The Silent
      Man, also, The Modest Man. Wherefore it behoveth thee to render thanks to Allah Almighty and not cross me, for I
      am a true counsellor to thee and benevolently minded towards thee. Would that I were in thy service a whole year
      that thou mightest do me justice; and I would ask thee no wage for all this." When I heard his flow of words, I
      said to him, "Doubtless thou wilt be my death this day!"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
      her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Thirtieth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young man said to the Barber, "Thou certainly will be
      the death of me this very day!" "O master mine," replied he, "I am he, The Silent Man hight, by reason of the
      fewness of my words, to distinguish me from my six brothers. For the eldest is called Al-Bakbúk, the prattler; the
      second Al-Haddár, the babbler; the third Al-Fakík, the gabbler; the fourth, his name is Al-Kuz al-aswáni, the long
      necked Gugglet, from his eternal chattering; the fifth is Al- Nashshár, the tattler and tale teller; the sixth
      Shakáshik, or many clamours; and the seventh is famous as Al-Sámit, The Silent Man, and this is my noble self!"
      Whilst he redoubled his talk, I thought my gall bladder would have burst; so I said to the servant, "Give him a
      quarter dinar and dismiss him and let him go from me in the name of God who made him. I won't have my head shaved
      to day." "What words be these, O my lord?" cried he. "By Allah! I will accept no hire of thee till I have served
      thee and have ministered to thy wants; and I care not if I never take money of thee. If thou know not my quality,
      I know thine; and I owe thy father, an honest man, on whom Allah Almighty have mercy! many a kindness, for he was
      a liberal soul and a generous. By Allah, he sent for me one day, as it were this blessed day, and I went in to him
      and found a party of his intimates about him. Quoth he to me, 'Let me blood;' so I pulled out my astrolabe and,
      taking the sun's altitude for him, I ascertained that the ascendant was inauspicious and the hour unfavourable for
      brooding. I told him of this, and he did according to my bidding and awaited a better opportunity. So I made these
      lines in honour of him:—</p>
    <p>I went to my patron some blood to let him, * But found that the<br />
           moment was far from good:<br />
      So I sat and I talked of all strangenesses, * And with jests and<br />
           jokes his good will I wooed:<br />
      They pleased him and cried he, 'O man of wit, * Thou hast proved<br />
           thee perfect in merry mood!'<br />
      Quoth I, 'O thou Lord of men, save thou * Lend me art and<br />
           wisdom I'm fou and wood<br />
      In thee gather grace, boon, bounty, suavity, * And I guerdon the<br />
           world with lore, science and gravity.'<br /></p>
    <p>Thy father was delighted and cried out to the servant, 'Give him an hundred and three gold pieces with a robe of
      honour!' The man obeyed his orders, and I awaited an auspicious moment, when I blooded him; and he did not baulk
      me; nay he thanked me and I was also thanked and praised by all present. When the blood-letting was over I had no
      power to keep silence and asked him, 'By Allah, O my lord, what made thee say to the servant, Give him an hundred
      and three dinars?'; and he answered, 'One dinar was for the astrological observation, another for thy pleasant
      conversation, the third for the phlebotomisation, and the remaining hundred and the dress were for thy verses in
      my commendation.'" "May Allah show small mercy to my father," exclaimed I, "for knowing the like of thee." He
      laughed and ejaculated, "There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God! Glory to Him that
      changeth and is changed not! I took thee for a man of sense, but I see thou babblest and dotest for illness. Allah
      hath said in the Blessed Book, 'Paradise is prepared for the goodly who bridle their anger and forgive
      men.' and so forth; and in any case thou art excused. Yet I cannot conceive the cause of thy hurry and flurry; and
      thou must know that thy father and thy grandfather did nothing without consulting me, and indeed it hath been said
      truly enough, 'Let the adviser be prized'; and, 'There is no vice in advice'; and it is also said in certain saws,
      'Whoso hath no counsellor elder than he, will never himself an elder be'; and the poet says:—</p>
    <p>Whatever needful thing thou undertake, * Consult th' experienced and contraire him not!</p>
    <p>And indeed thou shalt never find a man better versed in affairs than I, and I am here standing on my feet to
      serve thee. I am not vexed with thee: why shouldest thou be vexed with me? But whatever happen I will bear
      patiently with thee in memory of the much kindness thy father shewed me." "By Allah," cried I, "O thou with tongue
      long as the tail of a jackass, thou persistest in pestering me with thy prate and thou becomest more longsome in
      thy long speeches, when all I want of thee is to shave my head and wend thy way!" Then he lathered my head saying,
      "I perceive thou art vexed with me, but I will not take it ill of thee, for thy wit is weak and thou art but a
      laddy: it was only yesterday I used to take thee on my shoulder and carry thee to school.' "O my brother,"
      said I, "for Allah's sake do what I want and go thy gait!" And I rent my garments. When he saw me do this
      he took the razor and fell to sharpening it and gave not over stropping it until my senses were well nigh leaving
      me. Then he came up to me and shaved part of my head; then he held his hand and then he said, "O my lord, haste is
      Satan's gait whilst patience is of Allah the Compassionate. But thou, O my master, I ken thou knowest not my rank;
      for verily this hand alighteth upon the heads of Kings and Emirs and Wazirs, and sages and doctors learned in the
      law, and the poet said of one like me:—</p>
    <p>All crafts are like necklaces strung on a string, * But this<br />
           Barber's the union pear of the band:<br />
      High over all craftsmen he ranketh, and why? * The heads of the<br />
           Kings are under his hand!"<br /></p>
    <p>Then said I, "Do leave off talking about what concerneth thee not: indeed thou hast straitened my breast and
      distracted my mind." Quoth he, "Meseems thou art a hasty man;" and quoth I, "Yes ! yes! yes!" and he, "I rede thee
      practice restraint of self, for haste is Satan's pelf which bequeatheth only repentance and ban and bane, and He
      (upon whom be blessings and peace!) hath said, 'The best of works is that wherein deliberation lurks;' but I, by
      Allah! have some doubt about thine affair; and so I should like thee to let me know what it is thou art in such
      haste to do, for I fear me it is other than good." Then he continued, "It wanteth three hours yet to prayer time;
      but I do not wish to be in doubt upon this matter; nay, I must know the moment exactly, for truly, 'A guess shot
      in times of doubt, oft brings harm about;' especially in the like of me, a superior person whose merits are famous
      amongst mankind at large; and it doth not befit me to talk at random, as do the common sort of astrologers." So
      saying, he threw down the razor and taking up the astrolabe, went forth under the sun and stood there a long time;
      after which he returned and counting on his fingers said to me, "There remain still to prayer time three full
      hours and complete, neither more nor yet less, according to the most learned astronomicals and the wisest makers
      of almanacks." "Allah upon thee," cried I, "hold thy tongue with me, for thou breakest my liver in pieces." So he
      took the razor and, after sharpening it as before and shaving other two hairs of my head, he again held his hand
      and said, "I am concerned about thy hastiness and indeed thou wouldst do well to let me into the cause of it; 't
      were the better for thee, as thou knowest that neither thy father nor thy grandfather ever did a single thing save
      by my advice." When I saw that there was no escape from him I said to myself, "The time for prayer draws near and
      I wish to go to her before the folk come out of the mosque. If I am delayed much longer, I know not how to come at
      her." Then said I aloud, "Be quick and stint this talk and impertinence, for I have to go to a party at the house
      of some of my intimates." When he heard me speak of the party, he said, "This thy day is a blessed day for me! In
      very sooth it was but yesterday I invited a company of my friends and I have forgotten to provide anything for
      them to eat. This very moment I was thinking of it: Alas, how I shall be disgraced in their eyes!" "Be not
      distressed about this matter," answered I; "have I not told thee that I am bidden to an entertainment this day? So
      every thing in my house, eatable and drinkable, shall be thine, if thou wilt only get through thy work and make
      haste to shave my head." He replied, "Allah requite thee with good! Specify to me what is in thy house for my
      guests that I may be ware of it." Quoth I, "Five dishes of meat and ten chickens with reddened breasts and
      a roasted lamb." "Set them before me," quoth he "that I may see them." So I told my people to buy, borrow or steal
      them and bring them in anywise, And had all this set before him. When he saw it he cried, "The wine is wanting,"
      and I replied, "I have a flagon or two of good old grape- juice in the house," and he said, "Have it brought out!"
      So I sent for it and he exclaimed, "Allah bless thee for a generous disposition! But there are still the essences
      and perfumes." So I bade them set before him a box containing Nadd, the best of compound perfumes,
      together with fine lign-aloes, ambergris and musk unmixed, the whole worth fifty dinars. Now the time waxed strait
      and my heart straitened with it; so I said to him, "Take it all and finish shaving my head by the life of Mohammed
      (whom Allah bless and keep!)." "By Allah," said he, "I will not take it till I see all that is in it." So I bade
      the page open the box and the Barber laid down the astrolabe, leaving the greater part of my head unpolled; and,
      sitting on the ground, turned over the scents and incense and aloes wood and essences till I was well nigh
      distraught. Then he took the razor and coming up to me shaved off some few hairs and repeated these lines:—</p>
    <p>"The boy like his father shall surely show, * As the tree from its parent root shall grow."</p>
    <p>Then said he, "By Allah, O my son, I know not whether to thank thee or thy father; for my entertainment this day
      is all due to thy bounty and beneficence; and, although none of my company be worthy of it, yet I have a set of
      honourable men, to wit Zantut the bath-keeper and Sali'a the corn-chandler; and Silat the bean- seller; and
      Akrashah the greengrocer; and Humayd the scavenger; and Sa'id the camel-man; and Suwayd the porter; and Abu
      Makarish the bathman; and Kasim the watchman; and Karim the groom. There is not among the whole of them a
      bore or a bully in his cups; nor a meddler nor a miser of his money, and each and every hath some dance which he
      danceth and some of his own couplets which he caroleth; and the best of them is that, like thy servant, thy slave
      here, they know not what much talking is nor what forwardness means. The bath keeper sings to the tom- tom
      a song which enchants; and he stands up and dances and chants,</p>
    <p>'I am going, O mammy, to fill up my pot.'</p>
    <p>As for the corn-chandler he brings more skill to it than any; he dances and sings,</p>
    <p>'O Keener, 0 sweetheart, thou fallest not short'</p>
    <p>and he leaves no one's vitals sound for laughing at him. But the scavenger sings so that the birds stop to listen
      to him and dances and sings,</p>
    <p>'News my wife wots is not locked in a box!'</p>
    <p>And he hath privilege, for 'tis a shrewd rogue and a witty; and speaking of his excellence I am wont to
      say,</p>
    <p>My life for the scavenger! right well I love him, * Like a waving<br />
           bough he is sweet to my sight:<br />
      Fate joined us one night, when to him quoth I * (The while I grew<br />
           weak and love gained more might)<br />
      'Thy love burns my heart!' 'And no wonder,' quoth he * 'When the<br />
           drawer of dung turns a stoker wight.'<br /></p>
    <p>And indeed each is perfect in whatso can charm the wit with joy and jollity;" adding presently, "But hearing is
      not seeing; and indeed if thou make up thy mind to join us and put off going to thy friends, 'twill be better for
      us and for thee. The traces of illness are yet upon thee and haply thou art going among folk who be mighty
      talkers, men who commune together of what concerneth them not; or there may be amongst them some forward fellow
      who will split thy head, and thou half thy size from sickness." "This shall be for some other day," answered I,
      and laughed with heart angered: "finish thy work and go, in Allah Almighty's guard, to thy friends, for they will
      be expecting thy coming." "O my lord," replied he, "I seek only to introduce thee to these fellows of infinite
      mirth, the sons of men of worth, amongst whom there is neither procacity nor dicacity nor loquacity; for never,
      since I grew to years of discretion, could I endure to consort with one who asketh questions concerning what
      concerneth him not, nor have I ever frequented any save those who are, like myself, men of few words. In sooth if
      thou were to company with them or even to see them once, thou wouldst forsake all thy intimates." "Allah fulfil
      thy joyance with them," said I, "needs must I come amongst them some day or other." But he said, "Would it were
      this very day, for I had set my heart upon thy making one of us; yet if thou must go to thy friends to day, I will
      take these good things, wherewith thou hast honoured and favoured me, to my guests and leave them to eat and drink
      and not wait for me; whilst I will return to thee in haste and accompany thee to thy little party; for there is no
      ceremony between me and my intimates to prevent my leaving them. Fear not, I will soon be back with thee and wend
      with thee whithersoever thou wendest. There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
      Great!" I shouted, "Go thou to thy friends and make merry with them; and do let me go to mine and be with them
      this day, for they expect me." But the Barber cried, "I will not let thee go alone;" and I replied, "The truth is
      none can enter where I am going save myself." He rejoined, "I suspect that to day thou art for an assignation with
      some woman, else thou hadst taken me with thee; yet am I the right man to take, one who could aid thee to the end
      thou wishest. But I fear me thou art running after strange women and thou wilt lose thy life; for in this our city
      of Baghdad one cannot do any thing in this line, especially on a day like Friday: our Governor is an angry man and
      a mighty sharp blade." "Shame on thee, thou wicked, bad, old man!" cried I, "Be off! what words are these thou
      givest me?" "O cold of wit," cried he, "thou sayest to me what is not true and thou hidest thy mind from
      me, but I know the whole business for certain and I seek only to help thee this day with my best endeavour." I was
      fearful lest my people or my neighbours should hear the Barber's talk, so I kept silence for a long time whilst he
      finished shaving my head; by which time the hour of prayer was come and the Khutbah, or sermon, was about to
      follow. When he had done, I said to him, "Go to thy friends with their meat and drink, and I will await thy
      return. Then we will fare together." In this way I hoped to pour oil on troubled waters and to trick the accursed
      loon, so haply I might get quit of him; but he said, "Thou art cozening me and thou wouldst go alone to thy
      appointment and cast thyself into jeopardy, whence there will be no escape for thee. Now by Allah! and again by
      Allah! do not go till I return, that I may accompany thee and watch the issue of thine affair." "So be it," I
      replied, "do not be long absent." Then he took all the meat and drink I had given him and the rest of it and went
      out of my house; but the accursed carle gave it in charge of a porter to carry to his home but hid himself in one
      of the alleys. As for me I rose on the instant, for the Muezzins had already called the Salam of Friday, the
      salute to the Apostle; and I dressed in haste and went out alone and, hurrying to the street, took my
      stand by the house wherein I had seen the young lady. I found the old woman on guard at the door awaiting me, and
      went up with her to the upper story, the damsel's apartment. Hardly had I reached it when behold, the master of
      the house returned from prayers and entering the great saloon, closed the door. I looked down from the window and
      saw this Barber (Allah's curse upon him!) sitting over against the door and said, "How did this devil find me
      out?" At this very moment, as Allah had decreed it for rending my veil of secrecy, it so happened that a handmaid
      of the house master committed some offence for which he beat her. She shrieked out and his slave ran in to
      intercede for her, whereupon the Kazi beat him to boot, and he also roared out. The damned Barber fancied that it
      was I who was being beaten; so he also fell to shouting and tore his garments and scattered dust on his head and
      kept on shrieking and crying "Help ! Help !" So the people came round about him and he went on yelling, "My master
      is being murdered in the Kazi's house!" Then he ran clamouring to my place with the folk after him, and told my
      people and servants and slaves; and, before I knew what was doing, up they came tearing their clothes and letting
      loose their hair and shouting, "Alas, our master!"; and this Barber leading the rout with his clothes rent
      and in sorriest plight; and he also shouting like a madman and saying, "Alas for our murdered master!" And they
      all made an assault upon the house in which I was. The Kazi, hearing the yells and the uproar at his door, said to
      one of his servants, "See what is the matter"; and the man went forth and returned and said, "O my master, at the
      gate there are more than ten thousand souls what with men and women, and all crying out, 'Alas for our murdered
      master!'; and they keep pointing to our house." When the Kazi heard this, the matter seemed serious and he waxed
      wroth; so he rose and opening the door saw a great crowd of people; whereat he was astounded and said, "O folk!
      what is there to do?" "O accursed! O dog! O hog!" my servants replied; "'Tis thou who hast killed our master!"
      Quoth he, "O good folk, and what hath your master done to me that I should kill him?"— And Shahrazad perceived the
      dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Thirty-first Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Kazi said to the servants, "What hath your master done
      to me that I should kill him? This is my house and it is open to you all." Then quoth the Barber, "Thou didst beat
      him and I heard him cry out;" and quoth the Kazi, "But what was he doing that I should beat him, and what brought
      him in to my house; and whence came he and whither went he?" "Be not a wicked, perverse old man!" cried the
      Barber, "for I know the whole story; and the long and short of it is that thy daughter is in love with him and he
      loves her; and when thou knewest that he had entered the house, thou badest thy servants beat him and they did so:
      by Allah, none shall judge between us and thee but the Caliph; or else do thou bring out our master that his folk
      may take him, before they go in and save him perforce from thy house, and thou be put to shame." Then said the
      Kazi (and his tongue was bridled and his mouth was stopped by confusion before the people), "An thou say sooth, do
      thou come in and fetch him out." Whereupon the Barber pushed forward and entered the house. When I saw this I
      looked about for a means of escape and flight, but saw no hiding place except a great chest in the upper chamber
      where I was. So I got into it and pulled the lid down upon myself and held my breath. The Barber was hardly in the
      room before he began to look about for me, then turned him right and left and came straight to the place where I
      was, and stepped up to the chest and, lifting it on his head, made off as fast as he could. At this, my reason
      forsook me, for I knew that he would not let me be; so I took courage and opening the chest threw myself to the
      ground. My leg was broken in the fall, and the door being open I saw a great concourse of people looking in. Now I
      carried in my sleeve much gold and some silver, which I had provided for an ill day like this and the like of such
      occasion; so I kept scattering it amongst the folk to divert their attention from me and, whilst they were busy
      scrambling for it, I set off, hopping as fast as I could, through the by streets of Baghdad, shifting and turning
      right and left. But whithersoever I went this damned Barber would go in after me, crying aloud, "They would have
      bereft me of my master! They would have slain him who was a benefactor to me and my family and my friends! Praised
      be Allah who made me prevail against them and delivered my lord from their hands!" Then to me, "Where wilt thou go
      now? Thou wouldst persist in following thine own evil devices, till thou broughtest thyself to this ill pass; and,
      had not Allah vouchsafed me to thee, ne'er hadst thou escaped this strait into which thou hast fallen, for they
      would have cast thee into a calamity whence thou never couldest have won free. But I will not call thee to account
      for thine ignorance, as thou art so little of wit and inconsequential and addicted to hastiness!" Said I to him,
      "Doth not what thou hast brought upon me suffice thee, but thou must run after me and talk me such talk in the
      bazaar streets?" And I well nigh gave up the ghost for excess of rage against him. Then I took refuge in the shop
      of a weaver amiddlemost of the market and sought protection of the owner who drove the Barber away; and, sitting
      in the back room, I said to myself, "If I return home I shall never be able to get rid of this curse of a
      Barber, who will be with me night and day; and I cannot endure the sight of him even for a breathing space." So I
      sent out at once for witnesses and made a will, dividing the greater part of my property among my people, and
      appointed a guardian over them, to whom I committed the charge of great and small, directing him to sell my houses
      and domains. Then I set out on my travels that I might be free of this pimp; and I came to settle in your
      town where I have lived some time. When you invited me and I came hither, the first thing I saw was this accursed
      pander seated in the place of honour. How then can my heart be glad and my stay be pleasant in company with this
      fellow who brought all this upon me, and who was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my exile from home and
      native land. And the youth refused to sit down and went away. When we heard his story (continued the Tailor) we
      were amazed beyond measure and amused and said to the Barber, "By Allah, is it true what this young man saith of
      thee?" "By Allah," replied he, "I dealt thus by him of my courtesy and sound sense and generosity. Had it not been
      for me he had perished and none but I was the cause of his escape. Well it was for him that he suffered in his leg
      and not in his life! Had I been a man of many words, a meddler, a busy body, I had not acted thus kindly by him;
      but now I will tell you a tale which befell me, that you may be well assured I am a man sparing of speech in whom
      is no forwardness and a very different person from those six Brothers of mine; and this it is."</p>

    <h3><a id="chap29" />The Barber's Tale of Himself.</h3>
    <p>I was living in Baghdad during the times of Al-Mustansir bi'llah, Son of Al-Mustazi bi'llah the then
      Caliph, a prince who loved the poor and needy and companied with the learned and pious. One day it happened to him
      that he was wroth with ten persons, highwaymen who robbed on the Caliph's highway, and he ordered the Prefect of
      Baghdad to bring them into the presence on the anniversary of the Great Festival. So the Prefect sallied
      out and, making them His prisoners, embarked with them in a boat. I caught sight of them as they were embarking
      and said to myself, "These are surely assembled for a marriage feast; methinks they are spending their day in that
      boat eating and drinking, and none shall be companion of their cups but I myself." So I rose, O fair assembly;
      and, of the excess of my courtesy and the gravity of my understanding, I embarked with them and entered into
      conversation with them. They rowed across to the opposite bank, where they landed and there came up the watch and
      guardians of the peace with chains, which they put round the robbers' necks. They chained me among the rest of
      them; and, O people, is it not a proof of my courtesy and spareness of speech, that I held my peace and did not
      please to speak? Then they took us away in bilbos and next morning carried us all before Al- Mustansir bi'llah,
      Commander of the Faithful, who bade smite the necks of the ten robbers. So the Sworder came forward after they
      were seated on the leather of blood; then drawing his blade, struck off one head after another until he
      had smitten the neck of the tenth; and I alone remained. The Caliph looked at me and asked the Heads man, saying,
      "What ails thee that thou hast struck off only nine heads?"; and he answered, "Allah forbid that I should behead
      only nine, when thou biddest me behead ten!" Quoth the Caliph, "Meseems thou hast smitten the necks of only nine,
      and this man before thee is the tenth." "By thy beneficence!" replied the Headsman, "I have beheaded ten." "Count
      them!" cried the Caliph and whenas they counted heads, lo! there were ten. The Caliph looked at me and said, "What
      made thee keep silence at a time like this and how camest thou to company with these men of blood? Tell me the
      cause of all this, for albeit thou art a very old man, assuredly thy wits are weak." Now when I heard these words
      from the Caliph I sprang to my feet and replied, "Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that I am the Silent Shaykh and
      am thus called to distinguish me from my six brothers. I am a man of immense learning whilst, as for the gravity
      of my understanding, the wiliness of my wits and the spareness of my speech, there is no end of them; and my
      calling is that of a barber. I went out early on yesterday morning and saw these men making for a skiff; and,
      fancying they were bound for a marriage feast, I joined them and mixed with them. After a while up came the watch
      and guardians of the peace, who put chains round their necks and round mine with the rest; but, in the excess of
      my courtesy, I held my peace and spake not a word; nor was this other but generosity on my part. They brought us
      into thy presence, and thou gavest an order to smite the necks of the ten; yet did I not make myself known to thee
      and remained silent before the Sworder, purely of my great generosity and courtesy which led me to share with them
      in their death. But all my life long have I dealt thus nobly with mankind, and they requite me the foulest and
      evillest requital!" When the Caliph heard my words and knew that I was a man of exceeding generosity and of very
      few words, one in whom is no forwardness (as this youth would have it whom I rescued from mortal risk and who hath
      so scurvily repaid me), he laughed with excessive laughter till he fell upon his back. Then said he to me, "O
      Silent Man, do thy six brothers favour thee in wisdom and knowledge and spareness of speech?" I replied, "Never
      were they like me! Thou puttest reproach upon me, O Commander of the Faithful, and it becomes thee not to even my
      brothers with me; for, of the abundance of their speech and their deficiency of courtesy and gravity, each one of
      them hath gotten some maim or other. One is a monocular, another palsied, a third stone blind, a fourth cropped of
      ears and nose and a fifth shorn of both lips, while the sixth is a hunchback and a cripple. And conceive not, O
      Commander of the Faithful, that I am prodigal of speech; but I must perforce explain to thee that I am a man of
      greater worth and fewer words than any of them. From each one of my brothers hangs a tale of how he came by his
      bodily defect and these I will relate to thee." So the Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <h3><a id="chap30" />The Barber's Tale of his First Brother.</h3>
    <p>Know then, O Commander of the Faithful, that my first brother, Al Bakbuk, the Prattler, is a Hunchback who took
      to tailoring in Baghdad, and he used to sew in a shop hired from a man of much wealth, who dwelt over the
      shop, and there was also a flour-mill in the basement. One day as my brother, the Hunchback, was sitting
      in his shop a tailoring, he chanced to raise his head and saw a lady like the rising full moon at a balconied
      window of his landlord's house, engaged in looking out at the passers by. When my brother beheld her, his
      heart was taken with love of her and he passed his whole day gazing at her and neglected his tailoring till
      eventide. Next morning he opened his shop and sat him down to sew; but, as often as he stitched a stitch, he
      looked to the window and saw her as before; and his passion and infatuation for her increased. On the third day as
      he was sitting in his usual place gazing on her, she caught sight of him and, perceiving that he had been
      captivated with love of her, laughed in his face and he smiled back at her. Then she disappeared and
      presently sent her slave girl to him with a bundle containing a piece of red cowered silk. The handmaid accosted
      him and said, "My lady salameth to thee and desireth thee, of thy skill and good will, to fashion for her a shift
      of this piece and to sew it handsomely with thy best sewing. He replied, "Hearkening and obedience"; and shaped
      for her a chemise and finished sewing it the same day. When the morning morrowed the girl came back and said to
      him, "My lady salameth to thee and asks how thou hast passed yesternight; for she hath not tasted sleep by reason
      of her heart being taken up with thee. Then she laid before him a piece of yellow satin and said, My lady biddeth
      thee cut her two pair of petticoat trousers out of this piece and sew them this very day." "Hearkening and
      obedience!' replied he, "greet her for me with many greetings and say to her, Thy slave is obedient to thine
      order; so command him as thou wilt." Then he applied himself to cutting out and worked hard at sewing the
      trousers; and after an hour the lady appeared at the lattice and saluted him by signs, now casting down her eyes,
      then smiling in his face, and he began to assure himself that he would soon make a conquest. She did not let him
      stir till he had finished the two pair of trousers, when she with drew and sent the handmaid to whom he delivered
      them; and she took them and went her ways. When it was night, he threw himself on his carpet bed, and lay tossing
      about from side to side till morning, when he rose and sat down in his place. Presently the damsel came to him and
      said, "My master calleth for thee." Hearing these words he feared with exceeding fear; but the slave girl, seeing
      his affright, said to him, "No evil is meant to thee: naught but good awaiteth thee. My lady would have thee make
      acquaintance with my lord." So my brother the tailor, rejoicing with great joy, went with her; and when he came
      into the presence of his landlord, the lady's husband, he kissed the ground before him, and the master of the
      house returned his greeting and gave him a great piece of linen saying, "Shape me shirts out of this stuff and sew
      them well;" and my brother answered, "To hear is to obey." Thereupon he fell to work at once, snipping, shaping
      and sewing till he had finished twenty shirts by supper time, without stopping to taste food. The house master
      asked him, "How much the wage for this?"; and he answered, "Twenty dirhams." So the gentleman cried out to the
      slave girl, "Bring me twenty dirhams," and my brother spake not a word; but the lady signed, "Take nothing from
      him;' whereupon my brother said, "By Allah I will take naught from thy hand. And he carried off his tailor's gear
      and returned to his shop, although he was destitute even to a red cent. Then he applied himself to do
      their work; eating, in his zeal and diligence, but a bit of bread and drinking only a little water for three days.
      At the end of this time came the handmaid and said to him, "What hast thou done?" Quoth he, "They are finished,"
      and carried the shirts to the lady's husband, who would have paid him his hire: but he said, "I will take
      nothing," for fear of her and, returning to his shop, passed the night without sleep because of his hunger. Now
      the dame had informed her husband how the case stood (my brother knowing naught of this); and the two had agreed
      to make him tailor for nothing, the better to mock and laugh at him. Next morning he went to his shop, and, as he
      sat there, the handmaid came to him and said, "Speak with my master." So he accompanied her to the husband who
      said to him, "I wish thee to cut out for me five long sleeved robes." So he cut them out and took
      the stuff and went away. Then he sewed them and carried them to the gentleman, who praised his sewing and offered
      him a purse of silver. He put out his hand to take it, but the lady signed to him from behind her husband not to
      do so, and he replied, "O my lord, there is no hurry, we have time enough for this." Then he went forth from the
      house meaner and meeker than a donkey, for verily five things were gathered together in him viz.: love, beggary,
      hunger, nakedness and hard labour. Nevertheless he heartened himself with the hope of gaining the lady's favours.
      When he had made an end of all their jobs, they played him another trick and married him to their slave girl; but,
      on the night when he thought to go in to her, they said to him, "Lie this night in the mill; and to morrow all
      will go well." My brother concluded that there was some good cause for this and nighted alone in the mill. Now the
      husband had set on the miller to make the tailor turn the mill: so when night was half spent the man came in to
      him and began to say, "This bull of ours hath be come useless and standeth still instead of going round: he will
      not turn the mill this night, and yet we have great store of corn to be ground. However, I'll yoke him perforce
      and make him finish grinding it before morning, as the folk are impatient for their flour." So he filled the
      hoppers with grain and, going up to my brother with a rope in his hand, tied it round his neck and said to him,
      "Gee up! Round with the mill! thou, O bull, wouldst do nothing but grub and stale and dung!" Then he took a whip
      and laid it on the shoulders and calves of my brother, who began to howl and bellow; but none came to help him;
      and he was forced to grind the wheat till hard upon dawn, when the house master came in and, seeing my brother
      still tethered to the yoke and the man flogging him, went away. At day break the miller returned home and left him
      still yoked and half dead; and soon after in came the slave girl who unbound him, and said to him, "I and my lady
      are right sorry for what hath happened and we have borne thy grief with thee." But he had no tongue wherewith to
      answer her from excess of beating and mill turning. Then he retired to his lodging and behold, the clerk who had
      drawn up the marriage deed came to him and saluted him, saying, "Allah give thee long life! May thy
      espousal be blessed! This face telleth of pleasant doings and dalliance and kissing and clipping from dusk to
      dawn." "Allah grant the liar no peace, O thou thousandfold cuckold!", my brother replied, "by Allah, I did nothing
      but turn the mill in the place of the bull all night till morning!" "Tell me thy tale," quoth he; and my brother
      recounted what had befallen him and he said, "Thy star agrees not with her star; but an thou wilt I can alter the
      contract for thee," adding, "'Ware lest another cheat be not in store for thee." And my brother answered him, "See
      if thou have not another contrivance." Then the clerk left him and he sat in his shop, looking for some one to
      bring him a job whereby he might earn his day's bread. Presently the handmaid came to him and said, "Speak with my
      lady." "Begone, O my good girl," replied he, "there shall be no more dealings between me and thy lady." The
      handmaid returned to her mistress and told her what my brother had said and presently she put her head out of the
      window, weeping and saying, "Why, O my beloved, are there to be no more dealings 'twixt me and thee?" But he made
      her no answer. Then she wept and conjured him, swearing that all which had befallen him in the mill was not
      sanctioned by her and that she was innocent of the whole matter. When he looked upon her beauty and loveliness and
      heard the sweetness of her speech, the sorrow which had possessed him passed from his heart; he accepted her
      excuse and he rejoiced in her sight. So he saluted her and talked with her and sat tailoring awhile, after which
      the handmaid came to him and said, "My mistress greeteth thee and informeth thee that her husband purposeth to lie
      abroad this night in the house of some intimate friends of his; so, when he is gone, do thou come to us and spend
      the night with my lady in delightsomest joyance till the morning." Now her husband had asked her, "How shall we
      manage to turn him away from thee?"; and she answered, "Leave me to play him another trick and make him a laughing
      stock for all the town." But my brother knew naught of the malice of women. As soon as it was dusk, the slave girl
      came to him and carried him to the house, and when the lady saw him she said to him, "By Allah, O my lord, I have
      been longing exceedingly for thee." "By Allah," cried he, "kiss me quick before thou give me aught else."
      Hardly had he spoken, when the lady's husband came in from the next room and seized him, saying, "By
      Allah, I will not let thee go, till I deliver thee to the chief of the town watch." My brother humbled himself to
      him; but he would not listen to him and carried him before the Prefect who gave him an hundred lashes with a whip
      and, mounting him on a camel, promenaded him round about the city, whilst the guards proclaimed aloud, "This is
      his reward who violateth the Harims of honourable men!" Moreover, he fell off the camel and broke his leg and so
      became lame. Then the Prefect banished him from the city; and he went forth unknowing whither he should wend; but
      I heard of him and fearing for him went out after him and brought him back secretly to the city and restored him
      to health and took him into my house where he still liveth. The Caliph laughed at my story and said, "Thou hast
      done well, O Samit, O Silent Man, O spare of speech!"; and he bade me take a present and go away. But I said, "I
      will accept naught of thee except I tell thee what befell all my other brothers; and do not think me a man of many
      words." So the Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <p>Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that my second brother's name was Al-Haddar, that is the Babbler, and he was
      the paralytic. Now it happened to him one day, as he was going about his business, that an old woman accosted him
      and said, "Stop a little, my good man, that I may tell thee of somewhat which, if it be to thy liking, thou shalt
      do for me and I will pray Allah to give thee good of it!" My brother stopped and she went on, "I will put thee in
      the way of a certain thing, so thou not be prodigal of speech." "On with thy talk," quoth he; and she, "What
      sayest thou to handsome quarters and a fair garden with flowing waters, flowers blooming, and fruit growing, and
      old wine going and a pretty young face whose owner thou mayest embrace from dark till dawn? If thou do whatso I
      bid thee thou shalt see something greatly to thy advantage." "And is all this in the world?" asked my brother; and
      she answered, "Yes, and it shall be thine, so thou be reasonable and leave idle curiosity and many words, and do
      my bidding." "I will indeed, O my lady," said he, "how is it thou hast preferred me in this matter before all men
      and what is it that so much pleaseth thee in me?" Quoth she, "Did I not bid thee be spare of speech? Hold thy
      peace and follow me. Know, that the young lady, to whom I shall carry thee, loveth to have her own way and hateth
      being thwarted and all who gainsay; so, if thou humour her, thou shalt come to thy desire of her." And my brother
      said, "I will not cross her in anything." Then she went on and my brother followed her, an hungering after what
      she described to him till they entered a fine large house, handsome and choicely furnished, full of eunuchs and
      servants and showing signs of prosperity from top to bottom. And she was carrying him to the upper story when the
      people of the house said to him, "What dost thou here?" But the old woman answered them, "Hold your peace and
      trouble him not: he is a workman and we have occasion for him." Then she brought him into a fine great pavilion,
      with a garden in its midst, never eyes saw a fairer; and made him sit upon a handsome couch. He had not sat long,
      be fore he heard a loud noise and in came a troop of slave girls surrounding a lady like the moon on the night of
      its fullest. When he saw her, he rose up and made an obeisance to her, whereupon she welcomed him and bade him be
      seated. So he sat down and she said to him, "Allah advance thee to honour! Is all well with thee?" "O my lady," he
      answered, "all with me is right well." Then she bade bring in food, and they set before her delicate viands; so
      she sat down to eat, making a show of affection to my brother and jesting with him, though all the while she could
      not refrain from laughing; but as often as he looked at her, she signed towards her handmaidens as though she were
      laughing at them. My brother (the ass!) understood nothing; but, in the excess of his ridiculous passion, he
      fancied that the lady was in love with him and that she would soon grant him his desire. When they had done
      eating, they set on the wine and there came in ten maidens like moons, with lutes ready strung in their hands, and
      fell to singing with full voices, sweet and sad, whereupon delight gat hold upon him and he took the cup from the
      lady's hands and drank it standing. Then she drank a cup of wine and my brother (still standing) said to her
      "Health," and bowed to her. She handed him another cup and he drank it off, when she slapped him hard on the nape
      of his neck. Upon this my brother would have gone out of the house in anger; but the old woman followed
      him and winked to him to return. So he came back and the lady bade him sit and he sat down without a word. Then
      she again slapped him on the nape of his neck; and the second slapping did not suffice her, she must needs make
      all her handmaidens also slap and cuff him, while he kept saying to the old woman, "I never saw aught nicer than
      this." She on her side ceased not exclaiming, "Enough, enough, I conjure thee, O my mistress!"; but the women
      slapped him till he well nigh swooned away. Presently my brother rose and went out to obey a call of nature, but
      the old woman overtook him, and said, "Be patient a little and thou shalt win to thy wish." "How much longer have
      I to wait," my brother replied, "this slapping hath made me feel faint." "As soon as she is warm with wine,"
      answered she, "thou shalt have thy desire." So he returned to his place and sat down, where upon all the
      handmaidens stood up and the lady bade them perfume him with pastiles and besprinkle his face with rose- water.
      Then said she to him, "Allah advance thee to honour! Thou hast entered my house and hast borne with my conditions,
      for whoso thwarteth me I turn him away, and whoso is patient hath his desire." "O mistress mine," said he, "I am
      thy slave and in the hollow of thine hand!" "Know, then," continued she, "that Allah hath made me passionately
      fond of frolic; and whoso falleth in with my humour cometh by whatso he wisheth." Then she ordered her maidens to
      sing with loud voices till the whole company was delighted; after which she said to one of them, "Take thy lord,
      and do what is needful for him and bring him back to me forthright." So the damsel took my brother (and he not
      knowing what she would do with him); but the old woman overtook him and said, "Be patient; there remaineth but
      little to do." At this his face brightened and he stood up before the lady while the old woman kept saying, "Be
      patient; thou wilt now at once win to thy wish!"; till he said, "Tell me what she would have the maiden do with
      me?" "Nothing but good," replied she, "as I am thy sacrifice! She wisheth only to dye thy eyebrows and pluck out
      thy mustachios." Quoth he, "As for the dyeing of my eye brows, that will come off with washing, but for
      the plucking out of my mustachios, that indeed is a somewhat painful process." "Be cautious how thou cross her,"
      cried the old woman; "for she hath set her heart on thee." So my brother patiently suffered her to dye his
      eyebrows and pluck out his mustachios, after which the maiden returned to her mistress and told her. Quoth she
      "Remaineth now only one other thing to be done; thou must shave his beard and make him a smooth o' face."
      So the maiden went back and told him what her mistress had bidden her do; and my brother (the blockhead!) said to
      her, "How shall I do what will disgrace me before the folk?" But the old woman said, "She would do on this wise
      only that thou mayst be as a beardless youth and that no hair be left on thy face to scratch and prick her
      delicate cheeks; for indeed she is passionately in love with thee. So be patient and thou shalt attain thine
      object." My brother was patient and did her bidding and let shave off his beard and, when he was brought back to
      the lady, lo! he appeared dyed red as to his eyebrows, plucked of both mustachios, shorn of his beard, rouged on
      both cheeks. At first she was affrighted at him; then she made mockery of him and, laughing till she fell upon her
      back, said, "O my lord, thou hast indeed won my heart by thy good nature!" Then she conjured him, by her life, to
      stand up and dance, and he arose, and capered about, and there was not a cushion in the house but she threw it at
      his head, and in like manner did all her women who also kept pelting him with oranges and lemons and citrons till
      he fell down senseless from the cuffing on the nape of the neck, the pillowing and the fruit pelting. "Now thou
      hast attained thy wish," said the old woman when he came round; "there are no more blows in store for thee and
      there remaineth but one little thing to do. It is her wont, when she is in her cups, to let no one have her until
      she put off her dress and trousers and remain stark naked. Then she will bid thee doff thy clothes and
      run; and she will run before thee as if she were flying from thee; and do thou follow her from place to place till
      thy prickle stands at fullest point, when she will yield to thee;" adding, "Strip off thy clothes at
      once." So he rose, well nigh lost in ecstasy and, doffing his raiment, showed himself mother naked.—And Shahrazad
      perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Thirty-second Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman said to the Barber's second brother,
      "Doff thy clothes," he rose, well nigh lost in ecstasy; and, stripping off his raiment, showed himself mother
      naked. Whereupon the lady stripped also and said to my brother, "If thou want anything run after me till thou
      catch me." Then she set out at a run and he ran after her while she rushed into room after room and rushed out of
      room after room, my brother scampering after her in a rage of desire like a veritable madman, with yard standing
      terribly tall. After much of this kind she dashed into a darkened place, and he dashed after her; but suddenly he
      trod upon a yielding spot, which gave way under his weight; and, before he was aware where he was, he found
      himself in the midst of a crowded market, part of the bazaar of the leather sellers who were crying the prices of
      skins and hides and buying and selling. When they saw him in his plight, naked, with standing yard, shorn of beard
      and mustachios, with eyebrows dyed red, and cheeks ruddied with rouge, they shouted and clapped their hands at
      him, and set to flogging him with skins upon his bare body till a swoon came over him. Then they threw him on the
      back of an ass and carried him to the Chief of Police. Quoth the Chief, "What is this?" Quoth they, "This fellow
      fell suddenly upon us out of the Wazir's house in this state." So the Prefect gave him an hundred lashes
      and then banished him from Baghdad. However I went out after him and brought him back secretly into the city and
      made him a daily allowance for his living: although, were it not for my generous humour, I could not have put up
      with the like of him. Then the Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <h3><a id="chap32" />The Barber's Tale of his Third Brother.</h3>
    <p>My third brother's name was Al-Fakík, the Gabbler, who was blind. One day Fate and Fortune drove him to a fine
      large house, and he knocked at the door, desiring speech of its owner that he might beg somewhat of him. Quoth the
      master of the house, "Who is at the door?" But my brother spake not a word and presently he heard him repeat with
      a loud voice, "Who is this?" Still he made no answer and immediately heard the master walk to the door and open it
      and say, "What dost thou want?" My brother answered "Something for Allah Almighty's sake." "Art thou
      blind?" asked the man, and my brother answered "Yes." Quoth the other, "Stretch me out thy hand." So my brother
      put out his hand thinking that he would give him something; but he took it and, drawing him into the house,
      carried him up from stair to stair till they reached the terrace on the house top, my brother thinking the while
      that he would surely give him something of food or money. Then he asked my brother, "What dost thou want, O blind
      man?" and he answered, "Something for the Almighty's sake." "Allah open for thee some other door!" "O thou! why
      not say so when I was below stairs?" "O cadger, why not answer me when I first called to thee?" "And what meanest
      thou to do for me now?" "There is nothing in the house to give thee." "Then take me down the stair." "The path is
      before thee." So my brother rose and made his way downstairs, till he came within twenty steps of the door, when
      his foot slipped and he rolled to the bottom and broke his head. Then he went out, unknowing whither to turn, and
      presently fell in with two other blind men, companions of his, who said to him, "What didst thou gain to day?" He
      told them what had befallen him and added, "O my brothers, I wish to take some of the money in my hands and
      provide myself with it." Now the master of the house had followed him and was listening to what they said; but
      neither my brother nor his comrades knew of this. So my brother went to his lodging and sat down to await his
      companions, and the house owner entered after him without being perceived. When the other blind men arrived, my
      brother said to them, "Bolt the door and search the house lest any stranger have followed us." The man, hearing
      this, caught hold of a cord that hung from the ceiling and clung to it, whilst they went round about the house and
      searched but found no one. So they came back, and, sitting beside my brother, brought out their money which they
      counted and lo! it was twelve thousand dirhams. Each took what he wanted and they buried the rest in a corner of
      the room. Then they set on food and sat down, to eat. Presently my brother, hearing a strange pair of jaws
      munching by his side, said to his friends, "There is a stranger amongst us;" and, putting forth his hand,
      caught hold of that of the house master. Thereupon all fell on him and beat him; and when tired of
      belabouring him they shouted, "O ye Moslems! a thief is come in to us, seeking to take our money!" A crowd
      gathered around them, whereupon the intruder hung on to them; and complained with them as they complained, and,
      shutting his eyes like them, so that none might doubt his blindness, cried out, "O Moslems, I take refuge with
      Allah and the Governor, for I have a matter to make known to him!" Suddenly up came the watch and, laying hands on
      the whole lot (my brother being amongst them), drove them to the Governor's who set them before him and
      asked, "What news with you?" Quoth the intruder, "Look and find out for thyself, not a word shall be wrung from us
      save by torture, so begin by beating me and after me beat this man our leader." And he pointed to my
      brother. So they threw the man at full length and gave him four hundred sticks on his backside. The beating pained
      him, whereupon he opened one eye and, as they redoubled their blows, he opened the other eye. When the Governor
      saw this he said to him, "What have we here, O accursed?"; whereto he replied, "Give me the seal-ring of pardon!
      We four have shammed blind, and we impose upon people that we may enter houses and look upon the unveiled faces of
      the women and contrive for their corruption. In this way we have gotten great gain and our store amounts to twelve
      thousand dirhams. Said I to my company, 'Give me my share, three thousand;' but they rose and beat me and took
      away my money, and I seek refuge with Allah and with thee; better thou have my share than they. So, if thou
      wouldst know the truth of my words, beat one and every of the others more than thou hast beaten me, and he will
      surely open his eyes." The Governor gave orders for the question to begin with my brother, and they bound him to
      the whipping post, and the Governor said, "O scum of the earth, do ye abuse the gracious gifts of Allah
      and make as if ye were blind!" "Allah! Allah!" cried my brother, "by Allah, there is none among us who can see."
      Then they beat him till he swooned away and the Governor cried, "Leave him till he come to and then beat him
      again." After this he caused each of the companions to receive more than three hundred sticks, whilst the sham
      Abraham kept saying to them "Open your eyes or you will be beaten afresh." At last the man said to the Governor,
      "Dispatch some one with me to bring thee the money; for these fellows will not open their eyes, lest they incur
      disgrace before the folk." So the Governor sent to fetch the money and gave the man his pretended share, three
      thousand dirhams; and, keeping the rest for himself, banished the three blind men from the city. But I, O
      Commander of the Faithful, went out and overtaking my brother questioned him of his case; whereupon he told me of
      what I have told thee; so I brought him secretly into the city, and appointed him (in the strictest privacy) an
      allowance for meat and drink! The Caliph laughed at my story and said, "Give him a gift and let him go;" but I
      said, "By Allah! I will take naught till I have made known to the Commander of the Faithful what came to pass with
      the rest of my brothers; for truly I am a man of few words and spare of speech." Then the Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <h3><a id="chap33" />The Barber's Tale of his Fourth Brother.</h3>
    <p>Now as for my fourth brother, O Commander of the Faithful, Al-Kuz al-aswáni, or the long necked Gugglet hight,
      from his brimming over with words, the same who was blind of one eye, he became a butcher in Baghdad and he sold
      flesh and fattened rams; and great men and rich bought their meat of him, so that he amassed much wealth and got
      him cattle and houses. He fared thus a long while, till one day, as he was sitting in his shop, there came up an
      old man and long o' the beard, who laid down some silver and said, "Give me meat for this." He gave him his money
      s worth of flesh and the oldster went his ways. My brother examined the Shaykh's silver, and, seeing that the
      dirhams were white and bright, he set them in a place apart. The greybeard continued to return to the shop
      regularly for five months, and my brother ceased not to lay up all the coin he received from him in its own box.
      At last he thought to take out the money to buy sheep; so he opened the box and found in it nothing, save bits of
      white paper cut round to look like coin; so he buffeted his face and cried aloud till the folk gathered
      about him, whereupon he told them his tale which made them marvel exceedingly. Then he rose as was his wont, and
      slaughtering a ram hung it up inside his shop; after which he cut off some of the flesh, and hanging it outside
      kept saying to himself, "O Allah, would the ill omened old fellow but come!" And an hour had not passed before the
      Shaykh came with his silver in hand; where upon my brother rose and caught hold of him calling out, "Come aid me,
      O Moslems, and learn my story with this villain!" When the old man heard this, he quietly said to him, "Which will
      be the better for thee, to let go of me or to be disgraced by me amidst the folk?" "In what wilt thou disgrace
      me?" "In that thou sellest man's flesh for mutton!" "Thou liest, thou accursed!" "Nay, he is the accursed who hath
      a man hanging up by way of meat in his shop. If the matter be as thou sayest, I give thee lawful leave to take my
      money and my life." Then the old man cried out aloud, "Ho, ye people! if you would prove the truth of my words,
      enter this man's shop." The folk rushed in and found that the ram was become a dead man hung up for sale.
      So they set upon my brother crying out, "O Infidel! O villain!"; and his best friends fell to cuffing and kicking
      him and kept saying, "Dost thou make us eat flesh of the sons of Adam?" Furthermore, the old man struck him on the
      eye and put it out. Then they carried the carcass, with the throat cut, before the Chief of the city watch, to
      whom the old man said, "O Emir, this fellow butchers men and sells their flesh for mutton and we have brought him
      to thee; so arise and execute the judgments of Allah (to whom be honour and glory!)." My brother would have
      defended himself, but the Chief refused to hear him and sentenced him to receive five hundred sticks and to
      forfeit the whole of his property. And, indeed, had it not been for that same property which he expended in
      bribes, they would have surely slain him. Then the Chief banished him from Baghdad; and my brother fared forth at
      a venture, till he came to a great town, where he thought it best to set up as a cobbler; so he opened a shop and
      sat there doing what he could for his livelihood. One day, as he went forth on his business, he heard the distant
      tramp of horses and, asking the cause, was told that the King was going out to hunt and course; so my brother
      stopped to look at the fine suite. It so fortuned that the King's eye met my brother's; whereupon the King hung
      down his head and said, "I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this day!"; and turned the reins of his
      steed and returned home with all his retinue. Then he gave orders to his guards, who seized my brother and beat
      him with a beating so painful that he was well nigh dead; and my brother knew not what could be the cause of his
      maltreatment, after which he returned to his place in sorriest plight. Soon afterwards he went to one of the
      King's household and related what had happened to him; and the man laughed till he fell upon his back and cried,
      "O brother mine, know that the King cannot bear to look at a monocular, especially if he be blind of the right
      eye, in which case he doth not let him go without killing him." When my brother heard this, he resolved to fly
      from that city; so he went forth from it to another wherein none knew him and there he abode a long while. One
      day, being full of sorrowful thought for what had befallen him, he sallied out to solace himself; and, as he was
      walking along, he heard the distant tramp of horses behind him and said, "The judgement of Allah is upon me!" and
      looked about for a hiding place but found none. At last he saw a closed door which he pushed hard: it yielded. and
      he entered a long gallery in which he took refuge, but hardly had he done so, when two men set upon him crying
      out, "Allah be thanked for having delivered thee into our hands, O enemy of God! These three nights thou hast
      robbed us of our rest and sleep, and verily thou hast made us taste of the death cup." My brother asked, "O folk,
      what ails you?"; and they answered, "Thou givest us the change and goest about to disgrace us and plannest some
      plot to cut the throat of the house master! Is it not enough that thou hast brought him to beggary, thou and thy
      fellows? But now give us up the knife wherewith thou threatenest us every night." Then they searched him and found
      in his waist belt the knife used for his shoe leather; and he said, "O people, have the fear of Allah before your
      eyes and maltreat me not, for know that my story is a right strange!" "And what is thy story?" said they: so he
      told them what had befallen him, hoping they would let him go; however they paid no heed to what he said and,
      instead of showing some regard, beat him grievously and tore off his clothes: then, finding on his sides the scars
      of beating with rods, they said, "O accursed! these marks are the manifest signs of thy guilt!" They carried him
      before the Governor, whilst he said to himself, "I am now punished for my sins and none can deliver me save Allah
      Almighty!" The Governor addressing my brother asked him, "O villain, what led thee to enter their house with
      intention to murther?"; and my brother answered, "I conjure thee by Allah, O Emir, hear my words and be not hasty
      in condemning me!" But the Governor cried, "Shall we listen to the words of a robber who hath beggared these
      people, and who beareth on his back the scar of his stripes?" adding, "They surely had not done this to thee, save
      for some great crime." So he sentenced him to receive an hundred cuts with the scourge, after which they set him
      on a camel and paraded him about the city, proclaiming, "This is the requital and only too little to requite him
      who breaketh into people's houses." Then they thrust him out of the city, and my brother wandered at random, till
      I heard what had befallen him; and, going in search of him, questioned him of his case; so he acquainted me with
      his story and all his mischances, and I carried him secretly to the city where I made him an allowance for his
      meat and drink. Then the Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <h3><a id="chap34" />The Barber's Tale of his Fifth Brother.</h3>
    <p>My fifth brother, Al-Nashshár, the Babbler, the same who was cropped of both ears, O Commander of the
      Faithful, was an asker wont to beg of folk by night and live on their alms by day. Now when our father, who was an
      old man well stricken in years sickened and died, he left us seven hundred dirhams whereof each son took his
      hundred; but, as my fifth brother received his portion, he was perplexed and knew not what to do with it. While in
      this uncertainty he bethought him to lay it out on glass ware of all sorts and turn an honest penny on its price.
      So he bought an hundred dirhams worth of verroterie and, putting it into a big tray, sat down to sell it on a
      bench at the foot of a wall against which he leant back. As he sat with the tray before him he fell to musing and
      said to himself, "Know, O my good Self, that the head of my wealth, my principal invested in this glass ware, is
      an hundred dirhams. I will assuredly sell it for two hundred with which I will forthright buy other glass and make
      by it four hundred; nor will I cease to sell and buy on this wise, till I have gotten four thousand and soon find
      myself the master of much money. With these coins I will buy merchandise and jewels and ottars and gain
      great profit on them; till, Allah willing, I will make my capital an hundred thousand dirhams. Then I will
      purchase a fine house with white slaves and eunuchs and horses; and I will eat and drink and disport myself; nor
      will I leave a singing man or a singing woman in the city, but I will summon them to my palace and make them
      perform before me." All this he counted over in his mind, while the tray of glass ware,: worth an hundred dirhams,
      stood on the bench before him, and, after looking at it, he continued, "And when, Inshallah! my capital shall have
      become one hundred thousand dinars, I will send out marriage brokeresses to require for me in wedlock the
      daughters of Kings and Wazirs; and I will demand to wife the eldest daughter of the Prime Minister; for it hath
      reached me that she is perfect in beauty and prime in loveliness and rare in accomplishments. I will give a
      marriage settlement of one thousand dinars; and, if her father consent, well: but if not I will take her by force
      from under his very nose. When she is safely homed in my house, I will buy ten little eunuchs and for
      myself a robe of the robes of Kings and Sultans; and get me a saddle of gold and a bridle set thick with gems of
      price. Then I will mount with the Mamelukes preceding me and surrounding me, and I will make the round of the city
      whilst the folk salute me and bless me; after which I will repair to the Wazir (he that is father of the girl)
      with armed white slaves before and behind me and on my right and on my left. When he sees me, the Wazir stands up,
      and seating me in his own place sits down much below me; for that I am to be his son in law. Now I have with me
      two eunuchs carrying purses, each containing a thousand dinars; and of these I deliver to him the thousand, his
      daughter's marriage settlement, and make him a free gift of the other thousand, that he may have reason to know my
      generosity and liberality and my greatness of spirit and the littleness of the world in my eyes. And for ten words
      he addresses to me I answer him two. Then back I go to my house, and if one come to me on the bride's part, I make
      him a present of money and throw on him a dress of honour; but if he bring me a gift, I give it back to him and
      refuse to accept it, that they may learn what a proud spirit is mine which never condescends to derogate.
      Thus I establish my rank and status. When this is done I appoint her wedding night and adorn my house showily!
      gloriously! And as the time for parading the bride is come, I don my finest attire and sit down on a mattress of
      gold brocade, propping up my elbow with a pillow, and turning neither to the right nor to the left; but looking
      only straight in front for the haughtiness of my mind and the gravity of my understanding. And there before me
      stands my wife in her raiment and ornaments, lovely as the full moon; and I, in my loftiness and dread
      lordliness, will not glance at her till those present say to me, 'O our lord and our master, thy wife, thy
      handmaid, standeth before thee; vouchsafe her one look, for standing wearieth her.' Then they kiss the ground
      before me many times; whereupon I raise my eyes and cast at her one single glance and turn my face earthwards
      again. Then they bear her off to the bride chamber, and I arise and change my clothes for a far finer
      suit; and, when they bring in the bride a second time, I deign not to throw her a look till they have begged me
      many times; after which I glance at her out of the corner of one eye, and then bend down my head. I continue
      acting after this fashion till the parading and displaying are completed"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
      of day and ceased saying her per misted say.</p>

      bid them one and all lead me to the bride chamber. When they leave me alone with her I neither look at her nor
      speak to her, but lie by her side with my face to the wall showing my contempt, that each and every may
      again remark how high and haughty I am. Presently her mother comes in to me, and kissing my head and hand,
      says to me, 'O my lord, look upon thine handmaid who longs for thy favour; so heal her broken spirit!' I give her
      no answer; and when she sees this she rises and busses my feet many times and says, 'O my lord, in very sooth my
      daughter is a beautiful maid, who hath never known man; and if thou show her this backwardness and aversion, her
      heart will break; so do thou incline to her and speak to her and soothe her mind and spirit.' Then she rises and
      fetches a cup of wine; and says to her daughter, 'Take it and hand it to thy lord.' But as e approaches me I leave
      her standing between my hands and sit, propping my elbow on a round cushion purfled with gold thread, leaning
      lazily back, and without looking at her in the majesty of my spirit, so that she may deem me indeed a Sultan and a
      mighty man. Then she says to me, 'O my lord, Allah upon thee, do not refuse to take the cup from the hand of thine
      hand maid, for verily I am thy bondswoman.' But I do not speak to her and she presses me, saying, 'There is no
      help but that thou drink it;' and she puts it to my lips. Then I shake my fist in her face and kick her with my
      foot thus." So he let out with his toe an knocked over the tray of glass ware which fell to the ground and,
      falling from the bench, all that was on it was broken to bits. 'O foulest of pimps, this comes from the
      pride of my spirit'" cried my brother; and then, O Commander of the Faithful, he buffeted his face and rent his
      garments and kept on weeping and beating himself. The folk who were flocking to their Friday prayers saw him; and
      some of them looked at him and pitied him, whilst others paid no heed to him, and in this way my bother lost both
      capital and profit. He remained weeping a long while, and at last up came a beautiful lady, the scent of musk
      exhaling from her, who was going to Friday prayers riding a mule with a gold saddle and followed by several
      eunuchs. When she saw the broken glass and my brother weeping, her kind heart was moved to pity for him, and she
      asked what ailed him and was told that he had a tray full of glass ware by the sale of which he hoped to gain his
      living, but it was broken, and (said they), "there befell him what thou seest." Thereupon she called up one of her
      eunuchs and said to him, Give what thou hast with thee to this poor fellow!". And he gave my brother a purse in
      which he found five hundred dinars; and when it touched his hand he was well nigh dying for excess of joy and he
      offered up blessings for her. Then he returned to his abode a substantial man; and, as he sat considering, some
      one rapped at the door. So he rose and opened and saw an old woman whom he had never seen. "O my son," said she,
      "know that prayer tide is near and I have not yet made my Wuzu-ablution; so kindly allow me the use of thy
      lodging for the purpose." My brother answered, "To hear is to comply;" and going in bade her follow him. So she
      entered and he brought her an ewer wherewith to wash, and sat down like to fly with joy because of the dinars
      which he had tied up in his belt for a purse. When the old woman had made an end of her ablution, she came up to
      where he sat, and prayed a two bow prayer; after which she blessed my brother with a godly benediction, and he
      while thanking her put his hand to the dinars and gave her two, saying to himself "These are my
      voluntaries." When she saw the gold she cried, "Praise be to Allah! why dost thou look on one who loveth
      thee as if she were a beggar? Take back thy money: I have no need of it; or, if thou want it not, return it to her
      who gave it thee when thy glass ware was broken. Moreover, if thou wish to be united with her, I can manage the
      matter, for she is my mistress." "O my mother," asked my brother, "by what manner of means can I get at her?"; and
      she answered, "O my son! she hath an inclination for thee, but she is the wife of a wealthy man; so take the whole
      of thy money with thee and follow me, that I may guide thee to thy desire: and when thou art in her company spare
      neither persuasion nor fair words, but bring them all to bear upon her; so shalt thou enjoy her beauty and wealth
      to thy heart's content." My brother took all his gold and rose and followed the old woman, hardly believing in his
      luck. She ceased not faring on, and my brother following her, till they came to a tall gate at which she knocked
      and a Roumi slave-girl came out and opened to them. Then the old woman led my brother into a great sitting
      room spread with wondrous fine carpets and hung with curtains, where he sat down with his gold before him, and his
      turband on his knee. He had scarcely taken seat before there came to him a young lady (never eye saw
      fairer) clad in garments of the most sumptuous; whereupon my brother rose to his feet, and she smiled in his face
      and welcomed him, signing to him to be seated. Then she bade shut the door and, when it was shut, she turned to my
      brother, and taking his hand conducted him to a private chamber furnished with various kinds of brocades and gold
      cloths. Here he sat down and she sat by his side and toyed with him awhile; after which she rose and saying, "Stir
      not from thy seat till I come back to thee;" disappeared. Meanwhile as he was on this wise, lo! there came in to
      him a black slave big of body and bulk and holding a drawn sword in hand, who said to him, "Woe to thee! Who
      brought thee hither and what dost thou want here?" My brother could not return him a reply, being tongue tied for
      terror; so the blackamoor seized him and stripped him of his clothes and bashed him with the flat of his sword
      blade till he fell to the ground, swooning from excess of belabouring. The ill omened nigger fancied that there
      was an end of him and my brother heard him cry, "Where is the salt wench?" Where upon in came a handmaid
      holding in hand a large tray of salt, and the slave kept rubbing it into my brother's wounds; but he did
      not stir fearing lest the slave might find out that he was not dead and kill him outright. Then the salt girl went
      away, and the slave cried Where is the souterrain guardianess?" Hereupon in came the old woman and dragged
      my brother by his feet to a souterrain and threw him down upon a heap of dead bodies. In this place he lay two
      full days, but Allah made the salt the means of preserving his life by staunching the blood and staying its flow
      Presently, feeling himself able to move, Al-Nashshar rose and opened the trap door in fear and trembling and crept
      out into the open; and Allah protected him, so that he went on in the darkness and hid himself in the vestibule
      till dawn, when he saw the accursed beldam sally forth in quest of other quarry. He followed in her wake without
      her knowing it, and made for his own lodging where he dressed his wounds and medicined himself till he was whole.
      Meanwhile he used to watch the old woman, tracking her at all times and seasons, and saw her accost one man after
      another and carry them to the house. However he uttered not a word; but, as soon as he waxed hale and hearty, he
      took a piece of stuff and made it into a bag which he filled with broken glass and bound about his middle. He also
      disguised himself as a Persian that none might know him, and hid a sword under his clothes of foreign cut. Then he
      went out and presently, falling in with the old woman, said to her, speaking Arabic with a Persian accent,
      "Venerable lady, I am a stranger arrived but this day here where I know no one. Hast thou a pair of scales
      wherein I may weigh eleven hundred dinars? I will give thee somewhat of them for thy pains." "I have a son, a
      money changer, who keepeth all kinds of scales," she answered, "so come with me to him before he goeth out and he
      will weigh thy gold." My brother answered "Lead the way!" She led him to the house and the young lady herself came
      out and opened it, whereupon the old woman smiled in her face and said, "I bring thee fat meat today."
      Then the damsel took my brother by the hand, and led him to the same chamber as before; where she sat with him
      awhile then rose and went forth saying, "Stir not from thy seat till I come back to thee." Presently in came the
      accursed slave with the drawn sword and cried to my brother, "Up and be damned to thee." So he rose, and as the
      slave walked on before him he drew the sword from under his clothes and smote him with it, making head fly from
      body. Then he dragged the corpse by the feet to the souterrain and called out, "Where is the salt wench?" Up came
      the girl carrying the tray of salt and, seeing my brother sword in hand, turned to fly; but he followed her and
      struck off her head. Then he called out, "Where is the souterrain guardianess? , and in came the old woman to whom
      he said, "Dost know me again, ill omened hag?" "No my lord," she replied, and he said, "I am the owner of the five
      hundred gold pieces, whose house thou enteredst to make the ablution and to pray, and whom thou didst snare hither
      and betray." "Fear Allah and spare me," cried she; but he regarded her not and struck her with the sword till he
      had cut her in four. Then he went to look for the young lady; and when she saw him her reason fled and she cried
      out piteously "Aman! Mercy!" So he spared her and asked, "What made thee consort with this blackamoor?",
      and she answered, "I was slave to a certain merchant, and the old woman used to visit me till I took a liking to
      her. One day she said to me, 'We have a marriage festival at our house the like of which was never seen and I wish
      thee to enjoy the sight.' 'To hear is to obey,' answered I, and rising arrayed myself in my finest raiment and
      ornaments, and took with me a purse containing an hundred gold pieces. Then she brought me hither and hardly had I
      entered the house when the black seized on me, and I have remained in this case three whole years through the
      perfidy of the accursed beldam." Then my brother asked her, "Is there anything of his in the house?"; whereto she
      answered, "Great store of wealth, and if thou art able to carry it away, do so and Allah give thee good of it" My
      brother went with her and she opened to him sundry chests wherein were money bags, at which he was astounded; then
      she said to him, "Go now and leave me here, and fetch men to remove the money.", He went out and hired ten men,
      but when he returned he found the door wide open, the damsel gone and nothing left but some small matter of coin
      and the household stuffs. By this he knew that the girl had overreached him; so he opened the store rooms
      and seized what was in them, together with the rest of the money, leaving nothing in the house. He passed the
      night rejoicing, but when morning dawned he found at the door some twenty troopers who laid hands on him saying,
      "The Governor wants thee!" My brother implored them hard to let him return to his house; and even offered them a
      large sum of money; but they refused and, binding him fast with cords, carried him off. On the way they met a
      friend of my brother who clung to his skirt and implored his protection, begging him to stand by him and help to
      deliver him out of their hands. The man stopped, and asked them what was the matter, and they answered, "The
      Governor hath ordered us to bring this fellow before him and, look ye, we are doing so." My brother's friend urged
      them to release him, and offered them five hundred dinars to let him go, saying, "When ye return to the Governor
      tell him that you were unable to find him." But they would not listen to his words and took my brother, dragging
      him along on his face, and set him before the Governor who asked him, "Whence gottest thou these stuffs and
      monies?"; and he answered, "I pray for mercy!" So the Governor gave him the kerchief of mercy; and he told
      him all that had befallen him from first to last with the old woman and the flight of the damsel; ending with,
      "Whatso I have taken, take of it what thou wilt, so thou leave me sufficient to support life." But the
      Governor took the whole of the stuffs and all the money for himself; and, fearing lest the affair come to the
      Sultan's ears, he summoned my brother and said, "Depart from this city, else I will hang thee." "Hearing and
      obedience" quoth my brother and set out for another town. On the way thieves fell foul of him and stripped and
      beat him and docked his ears; but I heard tidings of his misfortunes and went out after him taking him clothes;
      and brought him secretly into the city where I assigned to him an allowance for meat and drink. And presently the
      Caliph gave ear to</p>

    <h3><a id="chap35" />The Barber's Tale of his Sixth Brother.</h3>
    <p>My sixth brother, O Commander of the Faithful, Shakashik, or Many clamours, the shorn of both lips, was
      once rich and became poor, so one day he went out to beg somewhat to keep life in him. As he was on the road he
      suddenly caught sight of a large and handsome mansion, with a detached building wide and lofty at the entrance,
      where sat sundry eunuchs bidding and forbidding. My brother enquired of one of those idling there and he
      replied "The palace belongs to a scion of the Barmaki house;" so he stepped up to the door keepers and asked an
      alms of them "Enter," said they, "by the great gate and thou shalt get what thou seekest from the Wazir our
      master." Accordingly he went in and, passing through the outer entrance, walked on a while and presently came to a
      mansion of the utmost beauty and elegance, paved with marble, hung with curtains and having in the midst of it a
      flower garden whose like he had never seen. My brother stood awhile as one bewildered not knowing whither
      to turn his steps; then, seeing the farther end of the sitting chamber tenanted, he walked up to it and there
      found a man of handsome presence and comely beard. When this personage saw my brother he stood up to him and
      welcomed him and asked him of his case; whereto he replied that he was in want and needed charity. Hearing these
      words the grandee showed great concern and, putting his hand to his fine robe, rent it exclaiming, "What! am I in
      a City, and thou here an hungered? I have not patience to bear such disgrace!" Then he promised him all manner of
      good cheer and said, "There is no help but that thou stay with me and eat of my salt." "O my lord,"
      answered my brother, "I can wait no longer; for I am indeed dying of hunger." So he cried, "Ho boy! bring basin
      and ewer;" and, turning to my brother, said, "O my guest come forward and wash thy hands." My brother rose to do
      so but he saw neither ewer nor basin; yet his host kept washing his hands with invisible soap in imperceptible
      water and cried, "Bring the table!" But my brother again saw nothing. Then said the host, "Honour me by eating of
      this meat and be not ashamed." And he kept moving his hand to and fro as if he ate and saying to my brother, "I
      wonder to see thee eating thus sparely: do not stint thyself for I am sure thou art famished." So my brother began
      to make as though he were eating whilst his host kept saying to him, "Fall to, and note especially the excellence
      of this bread and its whiteness!" But still my brother saw nothing. Then said he to himself, "This man is fond of
      poking fun at people;" and replied, "O my lord, in all my days I never knew aught more winsome than its whiteness
      or sweeter than its savour." The Barmecide said, "This bread was baked by a hand maid of mine whom I bought for
      five hundred dinars." Then he called out, "Ho boy, bring in the meat pudding for our first dish, and let
      there be plenty of fat in it;" and, turning to my brother said, "O my guest, Allah upon thee, hast ever seen
      anything better than this meat pudding? Now by my life, eat and be not abashed." Presently he cried out again, "Ho
      boy, serve up the marinated stew with the fatted sand grouse in it;" and he said to my brother, "Up and
      eat, O my guest, for truly thou art hungry and needest food." So my brother began wagging his jaws and made as if
      champing and chewing, whilst the host continued calling for one dish after another and yet produced
      nothing save orders to eat. Presently he cried out, "Ho boy, bring us the chickens stuffed with pistachio nuts;"
      and said to my brother, "By thy life, O my guest, I have fattened these chickens upon pistachios; eat, for thou
      hast never eaten their like." "O my lord," replied my brother, "they are indeed first rate." Then the host began
      motioning with his hand as though he were giving my brother a mouthful; and ceased not to enumerate and expatiate
      upon the various dishes to the hungry man whose hunger waxt still more violent, so that his soul lusted after a
      bit of bread, even a barley scone. Quoth the Barmecide, "Didst thou ever taste anything more delicious
      than the seasoning of these dishes?"; and quoth my brother, "Never, O my lord!" "Eat heartily and be not ashamed,"
      said the host, and the guest, "I have eaten my fill of meat;" So the entertainer cried, "Take away and bring in
      the sweets;" and turning to my brother said, "Eat of this almond conserve for it is prime and of these honey
      fritters; take this one, by my life, the syrup runs out of it." "May I never be bereaved of thee, O my lord,"
      replied the hungry one and began to ask him about the abundance of musk in the fritters. "Such is my custom," he
      answered: "they put me a dinar weight of musk in every honey fritter and half that quantity of ambergris." All
      this time my brother kept wagging head and jaws till the master cried, "Enough of this. Bring us the dessert!"
      Then said he to him,' "Eat of these almonds and walnuts and raisins; and of this and that (naming divers kinds of
      dried fruits), and be not abashed." But my brother replied, "O my lord, indeed I am full: I can eat no more." "O
      my guest," repeated the host, "if thou have a mind to these good things eat: Allah! Allah! do not remain
      hungry;" but my brother rejoined, "O my lord, he who hath eaten of all these dishes how can he be hungry?" Then he
      considered and said to himself, "I will do that shall make him repent of these pranks." Presently the entertainer
      called out "Bring me the wine;" and, moving his hands in the air, as though they had set it before them, he gave
      my brother a cup and said, "Take this cup and, if it please thee, let me know." "O my lord," he replied, "it is
      notable good as to nose but I am wont to drink wine some twenty years old." "Knock then at this door,"
      quoth the host "for thou canst not drink of aught better." "By thy kindness," said my brother, motioning with his
      hand as though he were drinking. "Health and joy to thee," exclaimed the house master and feigned to fill a cup
      and drink it off; then he handed another to my brother who quaffed it and made as if he were drunken. Presently he
      took the host unawares; and, raising his arm till the white of his armpit appeared, dealt him such a cuff on the
      nape of his neck that the palace echoed to it. Then he came down upon him with a second cuff and the entertainer
      cried aloud "What is this, O thou scum of the earth?" "O my lord," replied my brother, "thou hast shown much
      kindness to thy slave, and admitted him into thine abode and given him to eat of thy victual; then thou madest him
      drink of thine old wine till he became drunken and boisterous; but thou art too noble not to bear with his
      ignorance and pardon his offence." When the Barmaki heard my brother's words he laughed his loudest and said,
      "Long have I been wont to make mock of men and play the madcap among my intimates, but never yet have I come
      across a single one who had the patience and the wit to enter into all my humours save thyself: so I forgive thee,
      and thou shalt be my boon companion in very sooth and never leave me." Then he ordered the servants to lay the
      table in earnest and they set on all the dishes of which he had spoken in sport; and he and my brother ate till
      they were satisfied; after which they removed to the drinking chamber, where they found damsels like moons who
      sang all manner songs and played on all manner instruments. There they remained drinking till their wine got the
      better of them and the host treated my brother like a familiar friend, so that he became as it were his brother,
      and bestowed on him a robe of honour and loved him with exceeding love. Next morning the two fell again to
      feasting and carousing, and ceased not to lead this life for a term of twenty years; at the end of which the
      Barmecide died and the Sultan took possession of all his wealth and squeezed my brother of his savings, till he
      was left a pauper without a penny to handle. So he quitted the city and fled forth following his face;
      but, when he was half way between two towns, the wild Arabs fell on him and bound him and carried him to their
      camp, where his captor proceeded to torture him, saying, "Buy thy life of me with thy money, else I will slay
      thee!" My brother began to weep and replied, "By Allah, I have nothing, neither gold nor silver; but I am thy
      prisoner; so do with me what thou wilt." Then the Badawi drew a knife, broad bladed and so sharp grinded that if
      plunged into a camel's throat it would sever it clean across from one jugular to the other, and cut off my
      brother's lips and waxed more instant in requiring money. Now this Badawi had a fair wife who in her husband's
      absence used to make advances to my brother and offer him her favours, but he held off from her. One day she began
      to tempt him as usual and he played with her and made her sit on his lap, when behold, in came the Badawi who,
      seeing this, cried out, "Woe to thee, O accursed villain, wouldest thou debauch my wife for me?" Then he took out
      a knife and cut off my brother's yard, after which he bound him on the back of a camel and, carrying him to a
      mountain, left him there. He was at last found by some who recognised him and gave him meat and drink and
      acquainted me with his condition; whereupon I went forth to him and brought him back to Baghdad where I made him
      an allowance sufficient to live on. This, then, O Commander of the Faithful, is the history of my six brothers,
      and I feared to go away without relating it all to thee and leave thee in the error of judging me to be like them.
      And now thou knowest that I have six brothers upon my hands and, being more upright than they, I support the whole
      family. When the Caliph heard my story and all I told him concerning my brothers, he laughed and said, "Thou
      sayest sooth, O Silent Man! thou art indeed spare of speech nor is there aught of forwardness in thee; but now go
      forth out of this city and settle in some other." And he banished me under edict. I left Baghdad and travelled in
      foreign parts till I heard of his death and the accession of another to the Caliphate. Then I returned to Baghdad
      where I found all my brothers dead and chanced upon this young man, to whom I rendered the kindliest service, for
      without me he had surely been killed. Indeed he slanders me and accuses me of a fault which is not in my nature;
      and what he reports concerning impudence and meddling and forwardness is idle and false; for verily on his account
      I left Baghdad and travelled about full many a country till I came to this city and met him here in your company.
      And was not this, O worthy assemblage, of the generosity of my nature?</p>

    <h3><a id="chap36" />The End of the Tailor's Tale.</h3>
    <p>Then quoth the Tailor to the King of China: When we heard the Barber's tale and saw the excess of his loquacity
      and the way in which he had wronged this young man, we laid hands on him and shut him up, after which we sat down
      in peace, and ate and drank and enjoyed the good things of the marriage feast till the time of the call to mid
      afternoon prayer, when I left the party and returned home. My wife received me with sour looks and said, "Thou
      goest a pleasuring among thy friends and thou leavest me to sit sorrowing here alone. So now, unless thou take me
      abroad and let me have some amusement for the rest of the day, I will cut the rope and it will be the
      cause of my separation from thee." So I took her out and we amused ourselves till supper time, when we returned
      home and fell in with this Hunchback who was brimful of drink and trolling out these rhymes:</p>
    <p>"Clear's the wine, the cup's fine; * Like to like they combine:<br />
      It is wine and not cup! * 'Tis a cup and not wine!"<br /></p>
    <p>So I invited him to sup with us and went out to buy fried fish; after which we sat down to eat; and presently my
      wife took a piece of bread and a fid of fish and stuffed them into his mouth and he choked; and, though I slapped
      him long and hard between the shoulders, he died. Then I carried him off and contrived to throw him into the house
      of this leach, the Jew; and the leach contrived to throw him into the house of the Reeve; and the Reeve contrived
      to throw him on the way of the Nazarene broker. This, then, is my adventure which befell me but yesterday. Is not
      it more wondrous than the story of the Hunchback? When the King of China heard the Tailor's tale he shook his head
      for pleasure; and, showing great surprise, said, "This that passed between the young man and the busy-body of a
      Barber is indeed more pleasant and wonderful than the story of my lying knave of a Hunchback." Then he bade one of
      his Chamberlains go with the Tailor and bring the Barber out of jail, saying, "I wish to hear the talk of this
      Silent Man and it shall be the cause of your deliverance one and all: then we will bury the Hunchback, for that he
      is dead since yesterday, and set up a tomb over him."—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
      her per misted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Thirty-fourth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King of China bade, "Bring me the Barber who shall be
      the cause of your deliverance; then we will bury this Hunchback, for that he is dead since yesterday and set up a
      tomb over him." So the Chamberlain and the Tailor went to the jail and, releasing the Barber, presently returned
      with him to the King. The Sultan of China looked at him and considered him carefully and lo and behold! he was an
      ancient man, past his ninetieth year; swart of face, white of beard, and hoar of eyebrows; lop eared and
      proboscis-nosed, with a vacant, silly and conceited expression of countenance. The King laughed at this
      figure o' fun and said to him, "O Silent Man, I desire thee to tell me somewhat of thy history." Quoth the Barber,
      "O King of the age, allow me first to ask thee what is the tale of this Nazarene and this Jew and this Moslem and
      this Hunchback (the corpse) I see among you? And prithee what may be the object of this assemblage?" Quoth the
      King of China, "And why dost thou ask?" "I ask," he replied, "in order that the King's majesty may know that I am
      no forward fellow or busy body or impertinent meddler; and that I am innocent of their calumnious charges of
      overmuch talk; for I am he whose name is the Silent Man, and indeed peculiarly happy is my sobriquet, as saith the
      poet:</p>
    <p>When a nickname or little name men design, * Know that nature with name shall full oft combine."</p>
    <p>Then said the King, "Explain to the Barber the case of this Hunchback and what befell him at supper time; also
      repeat to him the stories told by the Nazarene, the Jew, the Reeve, and the Tailor; and of no avail to me is a
      twice told tale." They did his bidding, and the Barber shook his head and said, "By Allah, this is a marvel of
      marvels! Now uncover me the corpse of yonder Hunchback. They undid the winding sheet and he sat down and, taking
      the Hunchback's head in his lap, looked at his face and laughed and guffaw'd till he fell upon his back
      and said, "There is wonder in every death, but the death of this Hunchback is worthy to be written and
      recorded in letters of liquid gold!" The bystanders were astounded at his words and the King marvelled and said to
      him, "What ails thee, O Silent Man? Explain to us thy words !" "O King of the age," said the Barber, "I swear by
      thy beneficence that there is still life in this Gobbo Golightly!" Thereupon he pulled out of his waist belt a
      barber's budget, whence he took a pot of ointment and anointed therewith the neck of the Hunchback and its
      arteries. Then he took a pair of iron tweezers and, inserting them into the Hunchback's throat, drew out the fid
      of fish with its bone; and, when it came to sight, behold, it was soaked in blood. Thereupon the Hunchback sneezed
      a hearty sneeze and jumped up as if nothing had happened and passing his hand over his face said, "I testify that
      there is no god, but the God, and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God." At this sight all present
      wondered; the King of China laughed till he fainted and in like manner did the others. Then said the Sultan, "By
      Allah, of a truth this is the most marvellous thing I ever saw! O Moslems, O soldiers all, did you ever in the
      lives of you see a man die and be quickened again? Verily had not Allah vouchsafed to him this Barber, he had been
      a dead man!" Quoth they, "By Allah, 'tis a marvel of marvels." Then the King of China bade record this tale, so
      they recorded it and placed it in the royal muniment-rooms; after which he bestowed costly robes of honour upon
      the Jew, the Nazarene and the Reeve, and bade them depart in all esteem. Then he gave the Tailor a sumptuous dress
      and appointed him his own tailor, with suitable pay and allowances; and made peace between him and the Hunchback,
      to whom also he presented a splendid and expensive suit with a suitable stipend. He did as generously with the
      Barber, giving him a gift and a dress of honour; moreover he settled on him a handsome solde and created him
      Barber surgeon of state and made him one of his cup companions. So they ceased not to live the most
      pleasurable life and the most delectable, till there came to them the Destroyer of all delights and the Sunderer
      of all societies, the Depopulator of palaces and the Garnerer for graves. Yet, O most auspicious King! (continued
      Shahrazad) this tale is by no means more wonderful than that of the two Wazirs and Anís al-Jalís. Quoth her sister
