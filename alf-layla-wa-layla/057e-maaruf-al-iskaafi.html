    <h3><a id="chap01" />MA'ARUF THE COBBLER AND HIS WIFE</h3>
    <p>There dwelt once upon a time in the God-guarded city of Cairo a cobbler who lived by patching old shoes. His name
      was Ma'aruf and he had a wife called Fatimah, whom the folk had nicknamed "The Dung;" for that she was a whorish,
      worthless wretch, scanty of shame and mickle of mischief. She ruled her spouse and abused him; and he feared her
      malice and dreaded her misdoings; for that he was a sensible man but poor-conditioned. When he earned much, he
      spent it on her, and when he gained little, she revenged herself on his body that night, leaving him no peace and
      making his night black as her book; for she was even as of one like her said the poet:—
    </p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>How manifold nights have I passed with my wife * In the saddest<br />
             plight with all misery rife:<br />
        Would Heaven when first I went in to her * With a cup of cold<br />
             poison I'd ta'en her life.<br /></p>
    </div>


    <p>One day she said to him, "O Ma'aruf, I wish you to bring me this night a vermicelli-cake dressed with bees'
      honey." He replied, "So Allah Almighty aid me to its price, I will bring it you. By Allah, I have no dirhams
      to-day, but our Lord will make things easy." Rejoined she,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
      say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</p>
    <p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ma'aruf the Cobbler said to his spouse, "By Allah, I
      have no dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy to me!" She rejoined, "I wot naught of these words;
      look you come not to me save with the vermicelli and bees' honey; else will I make thy night black as thy fortune
      whenas you fellest into my hand." said he, "Allah is bountiful!" and going out with grief scattering itself from
      his body, prayed the dawn-prayer and opened his shop. After which he sat till noon, but no work came to him and
      his fear of his wife redoubled. Then he arose and went out perplexed as to how he should do in the matter of the
      vermicelli-cake, seeing he had not even the wherewithal to buy bread. Presently he came to the shop of the
      Kunafah-seller and stood before it, while his eyes brimmed with tears. The pastry-cook glanced at him and said,
      "O Master Ma'aruf, why dost you weep? Tell me what hath befallen you." So he acquainted him with his case,
      saying, "My wife would have me bring her a Kunafah; but I have sat in my shop till past mid-day and have not
      gained even the price of bread; wherefore I am in fear of her." The cook laughed and said, "No harm shall come to
      you. How many pounds wilt you have?" "Five pounds," answered Ma'aruf. So the man weighed him out five pounds of
      vermicelli-cake and said to him, "I have clarified butter, but no bees' honey. Here is drip-honey, however, which
      is better than bees' honey; and what harm will there be, if it be with drip-honey?" Ma'aruf was ashamed to object,
      because the pastry-cook was to have patience with him for the price, and said, "Give it me with drip-honey." So he
      fried a vermicelli-cake for him with butter and drenched it with drip-honey, till it was fit to present to Kings.
      Then he asked him, "Dost you want bread and cheese?"; and Ma'aruf answered, "Yes." So he gave him four half
      dirhams worth of bread and one of cheese, and the vermicelli was ten nusfs. Then said he, "Know, O Ma'aruf, that
      you owest me fifteen nusfs; so go to thy wife and make merry and take this nusf for the Hammam; and you shalt
      have credit for a day or two or three till Allah provide you with thy daily bread. And straiten not thy wife, for
      I will have patience with you till such time as you shalt have dirhams to spare." So Ma'aruf took the
      vermicelli-cake and bread and cheese and went away, with a heart at ease, blessing the pastry-cook and saying,
      "Extolled be Thy perfection, O my Lord! How bountiful art Thou!" When he came home, his wife enquired of him,
      "has you brought the vermicelli-cake?"; and, replying "Yes," he set it before her. She looked at it and seeing
      that it was dressed with cane-honey, said to him, "Did I not bid you bring it with bees' honey? Wilt thou
      contrary my wish and have it dressed with cane-honey?" He excused himself to her, saying, "I bought it not save on
      credit;" but said she, "This talk is idle; I will not eat Kunafah save with bees' honey." And she was wroth with
      it and threw it in his face, saying, "Begone, you pimp, and bring me other than this !" Then she dealt him a
      buffet on the cheek and knocked out one of his teeth. The blood ran down upon his breast and for stress of anger
      he smote her on the head a single blow and a slight; whereupon she clutched his beard and fell to shouting out and
      saying, "Help, O Moslems!" So the neighbours came in and freed his beard from her grip; then they reproved and
      reproached her, saying, "We are all content to eat Kunafah with cane-honey. Why, then, wilt you oppress this poor
      man thus? Verily, this is disgraceful in you!" And they went on to soothe her till they made peace between her
      and him. But, when the folk were gone, she swored that she would not eat of the vermicelli, and Ma'aruf, burning
      with hunger, said in himself, "She swore that she will not eat; so I will e'en eat." Then he ate, and when she
      saw him eating, she said, "Insha Allah, may the eating of it be poison to destroy the far one's body." said he,
      "It
      shall not be at thy bidding," and went on eating, laughing and saying, "you swore that you would not eat of
      this; but Allah is bountiful, and to-morrow night, an the Lord decree, I will bring you Kunafah dressed with
      bees' honey, and you shalt eat it alone." And he applied himself to appeasing her, while she called down curses
      upon him; and she ceased not to rail at him and revile him with gross abuse till the morning, when she bared her
      forearm to beat him. said he, "Give me time and I will bring you other vermicelli-cake." Then he went out to the
      mosque and prayed, after which he betook himself to his shop and opening it, sat down; but hardly had he done this
      when up came two runners from the Kazi's court and said to him, "Up with you, speak with the Kazi, for thy wife
      hath complained of you to him and her favour is thus and thus." He recognised her by their description; and
      saying, "May Allah Almighty torment her!" walked with them till he came to the Kazi's presence, where he found
      Fatimah standing with her arm bound up and her face-veil besmeared with blood; and she was weeping and wiping away
      her tears. said the Kazi, "Ho man, has you no fear of Allah the Most High? Why has you beaten this good woman
      and broken her forearm and knocked out her tooth and entreated her thus?" And said Ma'aruf, "If I beat her or put
      out her tooth, sentence me to what you wilt; but in truth the case was thus and thus and the neighbours made
      peace between me and her." And he told him the story from first to last. Now this Kazi was a benevolent man; so he
      brought out to him a quarter dinar, saying, "O man, take this and get her Kunafah with bees' honey and do ye make
      peace, you and she." said Ma'aruf, "Give it to her." So she took it and the Kazi made peace between them,
      saying, "O wife, obey thy husband; and thou, O man, deal kindly with her." Then they left the court, reconciled at
      the Kazi's hands, and the woman went one way, while her husband returned by another way to his shop and sat
      there, when, behold, the runners came up to him and said, "Give us our fee." said he, "The Kazi took not of me
      aught; on the contrary, he gave me a quarter dinar." But said they "'Tis no concern of ours whether the Kazi took
      of you or gave to you, and if you give us not our fee, we will exact it in despite of you." And they fell to
      dragging him about the market; so he sold his tools and gave them half a dinar, whereupon they let him go and went
      away, while he put his hand to his cheek and sat sorrowful, for that he had no tools wherewith to work.
      Presently, up came two ill-favoured fellows and said to him, "Come, O man, and speak with the Kazi; for thy wife
      hath complained of you to him." Said he, "He made peace between us just now." But said they, "We come from
      another Kazi, and thy wife hath complained of you to our Kazi." So he arose and went with them to their Kazi,
      calling on Allah for aid against her; and when he saw her, he said to her, "Did we not make peace, good woman?"
      Whereupon she cried, "There abides no peace between me and you." Accordingly he came forward and told the Kazi
      his story, adding, "And indeed the Kazi Such-an-one made peace between us this very hour." Whereupon the Kazi said
      to her, "O strumpet, since ye two have made peace with each other, why did you come to me complaining?" said she,
      "He beat me after that;" but said the Kazi, "Make peace each with other, and beat her not again, and she will
      cross you no more." So they made peace and the Kazi said to Ma'aruf, "Give the runners their fee." So he gave
      them their fee and going back to his shop, opened it and sat down, as he were a drunken man for excess of the
      chagrin which befell him. Presently, while he was still sitting, behold, a man came up to him and said, "O
      Ma'aruf,
      rise and hide thyself, for thy wife hath complained of you to the High Court and Abú Tabak is after you." So he
      shut his shop and fled towards the Gate of Victory. He had five nusfs of silver left of the price of the lasts and
      gear; and therewith he bought four worth of bread and one of cheese, as he fled from her. Now it was the winter
      season and the hour of mid-afternoon prayer; so, when he came out among the rubbish-mounds the rain descended upon
      him, like water from the mouths of water-skins, and his clothes were drenched. He therefore entered the 'Adiliyah,
      where he saw a ruined place and therein a deserted cell without a door; and in it he took refuge and found shelter
      from the rain. The tears streamed from his eyelids, and he fell to complaining of what had betided him and saying,
      "Whither shall I flee from this whore? I beseech you, O Lord, to vouchsafe me one who shall conduct me to a far
      country, where she shall not know the way to me!" Now while he sat weeping, behold, the wall clave and there came
      forth to him therefrom one of tall stature, whose aspect caused his body-pile to bristle and his flesh to creep,
      and said to him, "O man, what aileth you that disturbed me this night? These two hundred years have I dwelt
      here and have never seen any enter this place and do as you dost. Tell me what you wishest and I will accomplish
      thy need, as ruth for you hath got hold upon my heart." said Ma'aruf, "Who and what art thou?"; and said he, "I
      am the Haunter of this place." So Ma'aruf told him all that had befallen him with his wife and he said, "Wilt thou
      have me convey you to a country, where thy wife shall know no way to you?" "Yes," said Ma'aruf; and the other,
      "Then mount my back." So he mounted on his back and he flew with him from after supper-tide till daybreak, when he
      set him down on the top of a high mountain—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
      say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Marid having taken up Ma'aruf the Cobbler, flew off
      with him and set him down upon a high mountain and said to him, "O mortal, descend this mountain and you wilt see
      the gate of a city. Enter it, for therein thy wife cannot come at you." He then left him and went his way, while
      Ma'aruf abode in amazement and perplexity till the sun rose, when he said to himself, "I will up with me and go
      down into the city: indeed there is no profit in my abiding upon this highland." So he descended to the
      mountain-foot and saw a city girt by towering walls, full of lofty palaces and gold-adorned buildings which was a
      delight to beholders. He entered in at the gate and found it a place such as lightened the grieving heart; but, as
      he walked through the streets the townsfolk stared at him as a curiosity and gathered about him, marvelling at his
      dress, for it was unlike theirs. Presently, one of them said to him, "O man, art you a stranger?" "Yes." "What
      countryman art thou?" "I am from the city of Cairo the Auspicious." "And when didst you leave Cairo?" "I left it
      yesterday, at the hour of afternoon-prayer." Whereupon the man laughed at him and cried out, saying, "Come look, O
      folk, at this man and hear what he said!" said they, "What did he say?"; and said the townsman, "He
      pretended that he came from Cairo and left it yesterday at the hour of afternoon-prayer!" At this they all
      laughed and gathering round Ma'aruf, said to him, "O man, art you mad to talk thus? How canst you pretend that
      you leftest Cairo at mid-afternoon yesterday and found thyself this morning here, when the truth is that
      between our city and Cairo lieth a full year's journey?" said he, "None is mad but you. As for me, I speak sooth,
      for here is bread which I brought with me from Cairo, and see, 'tis yet new." Then he showed them the bread and
      they stared at it, for it was unlike their country bread. So the crowd increased about him and they said to one
      another, "This is Cairo bread: look at it;" and he became a gazing-stock in the city and some believed him, while
      others gave him the lie and made mock of him. while this was going on, behold, up came a merchant riding on a
      she-mule and followed by two black slaves, and brake a way through the people, saying, "O folk, are ye not ashamed
      to mob this stranger and make mock of him and scoff at him?" And he went on to rate them, till he drave them away
      from Ma'aruf, and none could make him any answer. Then he said to the stranger, "Come, O my brother, no harm shall
      betide you from these folk. Verily they have no shame." So he took him and carrying him to a spacious and
      richly-adorned house, seated him in a speak-room fit for a King, while he gave an order to his slaves, who opened
      a chest and brought out to him a dress such as might be worn by a merchant worth a thousand. He clad him therewith
      and Ma'aruf, being a seemly man, became as he were consul of the merchants. Then his host called for food and they
      set before them a tray of all manner exquisite viands. The twain ate and drank and the merchant said to Ma'aruf,
      "O my brother, what is thy name?" "My name is Ma'aruf and I am a cobbler by trade and patch old shoes." "What
      countryman art thou?" "I am from Cairo." "What quarter?" "Dost you know Cairo?" "I am of its children. I come
      from the Red Street." "And whom dost you know in the Red Street?" "I know such an one and such an one," answered
      Ma'aruf and named several people to him. said the other, "Knowest you Shaykh Ahmad the druggist?" "He was my
      next neighbour, wall to wall." "Is he well?" "Yes." "How many sons hath he?" "Three, Mustafà, Mohammed and Ali."
      "And what hath Allah done with them?" "As for Mustafà, he is well and he is a learned man, a professor: Mohammed
      is a druggist and opened him a shop beside that of his father, after he had married, and his wife hath borne him a
      son named Hasan." "Allah gladden you with good news!" said the merchant; and Ma'aruf continued, "As for Ali, he
      was my friend, when we were boys, and we always played together, I and he. We used to go in the guise of the
      children of the Nazarenes and enter the church and steal the books of the Christians and sell them and buy food
      with the price. It chanced once that the Nazarenes caught us with a book; whereupon they complained of us to our
      folk and said to Ali's father: An you hinder not thy son from troubling us, we will complain of you to the King.
      So he appeased them and gave Ali a thrashing; wherefore he ran away none knew whither and he hath now been absent
      twenty years and no man hath brought news of him." said the host, "I am that very Ali, son of Shaykh Ahmad the
      druggist, and you art my playmate Ma'aruf." So they saluted each other and after the salam Ali said, "Tell me
      why, O Ma'aruf, you camest from Cairo to this city." Then he told him all that had befallen him of ill-doing with
      his wife Fatimah the Dung and said, "So, when her annoy waxed on me, I fled from her towards the Gate of Victory
      and went forth the city. Presently, the rain fell heavy on me; so I entered a ruined cell in the Adiliyah and sat
      there, weeping; whereupon there came forth to me the Haunter of the place, which was an Ifrit of the Jinn, and
      questioned me. I acquainted him with my case and he took me on his back and flew with me all night between heaven
      and earth, till he set me down on yonder mountain and gave me to know of this city. So I came down from the
      mountain and entered the city, when people crowded about me and questioned me. I told them that I had left Cairo
      yesterday, but they believed me not, and presently you came up and driving the folk away from me, carried me
      this house. Such, then, is the cause of my quitting Cairo; and thou, what object brought you hither?" said Ali,
      "The giddiness of folly turned my head when I was seven years old, from which time I wandered from land to land
      and city to city, till I came to this city, the name whereof is Ikhtiyán al-Khatan. I found its people an
      hospitable folk and a kindly, compassionate for the poor man and selling to him on credit and believing all he
      said. So said I to them:—I am a merchant and have preceded my packs and I need a place wherein to bestow my
      baggage. And they believed me and assigned me a lodging. Then said I to them:—Is there any of you will lend me a
      thousand dinars, till my loads arrive, when I will repay it to him; for I am in want of certain things before my
      goods come? They gave me what I asked and I went to the merchants' bazar, where, seeing goods, I bought them and
      sold them next day at a profit of fifty gold pieces and bought others. And I consorted with the folk and entreated
      them liberally, so that they loved me, and I continued to sell and buy, till I grew rich. Know, O my brother, that
      the proverb said, The world is show and trickery: and the land where none wotteth you, there do whatso liketh
      you. you too, an you say to all who ask you, I'm a cobbler by trade and poor withal, and I fled from my wife
      and left Cairo yesterday, they will not believe you and you wilt be a laughing-stock among them as long as thou
      abide in the city; while, an you tell them, An Ifrit brought me hither, they will take fright at you and none
      will come near you; for they will say, This man is possessed of an Ifrit and harm will betide whoso approacheth
      him. And such public report will be dishonouring both to you and to me, because they ken I come from Cairo."
      Ma'aruf asked:—"How then shall I do?"; and Ali answered, "I will tell you how you shalt do, Inshallah! To-morrow
      I will give you a thousand dinars and a she-mule to ride and a black slave, who shall walk before you and guide
      you to the gate of the merchants' bazar; and do you go into them. I will be there sitting amongst them, and when
      I see you, I will rise to you and salute you with the salam and kiss thy hand and make a great man of you.
      Whenever I ask you of any kind of stuff, saying, has you brought with you aught of such a kind? do thou
      answer, "Plenty." And if they question me of you, I will praise you and magnify you in their eyes and say to
      them, Get him a store-house and a shop. I also will give you out for a man of great wealth and generosity; and if
      a beggar come to you, bestow upon him what you mayst; so will they put faith in what I say and believe in thy
      greatness and generosity and love you. Then will I invite you to my house and invite all the merchants on thy
      account and bring together you and them, so that all may know you and you know them,"—And Shahrazad perceived
      the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-second Night,</p>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant Ali said to Ma'aruf, "I will invite you
      to my house and invite all the merchants on thy account and bring together you and them, so that all may know
      you and you know them, whereby you shalt sell and buy and take and give with them; nor will it be long ere thou
      become a man of money." Accordingly, on the morrow he gave him a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a black
      slave and mounting him on a she-mule, said to him, "Allah give you quittance of responsibility for all this,
      inasmuch as you are my friend and it behoved me to deal generously with you. Have no care; but put away from
      you the thought of thy wife's misways and name her not to any." "Allah requite you with good!" replied Ma'aruf
      and rode on, preceded by his blackamoor till the slave brought him to the gate of the merchants' bazar, where they
      were all seated, and amongst them Ali, who when he saw him, rose and threw himself upon him, crying, "A blessed
      day, O Merchant Ma'aruf, O man of good works and kindness!" And he kissed his hand before the merchants and said
      to them, "Our brothers, ye are honoured by knowing the merchant Ma'aruf." So they saluted him, and Ali signed to
      them to make much of him, wherefore he was magnified in their eyes. Then Ali helped him to dismount from his
      she-mule and saluted him with the salam; after which he took the merchants apart, one after other, and vaunted
      Ma'aruf to them. They asked, "Is this man a merchant?;" and he answered, "Yes; and indeed he is the chiefest of
      merchants, there lived not a wealthier than he; for his wealth and the riches of his father and forefathers are
      famous among the merchants of Cairo. He hath partners in Hind and Sind and Al-Yaman and is high in repute for
      generosity. So know ye his rank and exalt ye his degree and do him service, and wot also that his coming to your
      city is not for the sake of traffic, and none other save to divert himself with the sight of folk's countries:
      indeed, he hath no need of strangerhood for the sake of gain and profit, having wealth that fires cannot consume,
      and I am one of his servants." And he ceased not to extol him, till they set him above their heads and began to
      tell one another of his qualities. Then they gathered round him and offered him junkets and sherbets, and even the
      Consul of the Merchants came to him and saluted him; while Ali proceeded to ask him, in the presence of the
      traders, "O my lord, haply you has brought with you somewhat of such and such a stuff?"; and Ma'aruf
      answered,"Plenty." Now Ali had that day shown him various kinds of costly clothes and had taught him the names of
      the different stuffs, dear and cheap. Then said one of the merchants, "O my lord, has you brought with you
      yellow broad cloth?": and Ma'aruf said, "Plenty"! said another, "And gazelles' blood red?"; and said the
      Cobbler, "Plenty"; and as often as he asked him of aught, he made him the same answer. So the other said, "O
      Merchant Ali had thy countryman a mind to transport a thousand loads of costly stuffs, he could do so"; and Ali
      said, "He would take them from a single one of his store-houses, and miss naught thereof." Now while they were
      sitting, behold, up came a beggar and went the round of the merchants. One gave him a half dirham and another a
      copper, but most of them gave him nothing, till he came to Ma'aruf who pulled out a handful of gold and gave it to
      him, whereupon he blessed him and went his ways. The merchants marvelled at this and said, "Verily, this is a
      King's bestowal for he gave the beggar gold without count, and were he not a man of vast wealth and money without
      end, he had not given a beggar a handful of gold." After a while, there came to him a poor woman and he gave her a
      handful of gold; whereupon she went away, blessing him, and told the other beggars, who came to him, one after
      other, and he gave them each a handful of gold, till he disbursed the thousand dinars. Then he struck hand upon
      hand and said, "Allah is our sufficient aid and excellent is the Agent!" said the Consul, "What aileth you, O
      Merchant Ma'aruf?"; and said he, "It seemed that the most part of the people of this city are poor and needy;
      had I known their misery I would have brought with me a large sum of money in my saddle-bags and given largesse
      thereof to the poor. I fear me I may be long abroad and 'tis not in my nature to baulk a beggar; and I have no
      gold left: so, if a pauper come to me, what shall I say to him?" said the Consul, "Say, Allah will send you thy
      daily bread!"; but Ma'aruf replied, "That is not my practice and I am care-ridden because of this. Would I had
      other thousand dinars, wherewith to give alms till my baggage come!" "Have no care for that," said the Consul and
      sending one of his dependents for a thousand dinars, handed them to Ma'aruf, who went on giving them to every
      beggar who passed till the call to noon-prayer. Then they entered the Cathedral-mosque and prayed the
      noon-prayers, and what was left him of the thousand gold pieces he scattered on the heads of the worshippers. This
      drew the people's attention to him and they blessed him, while the merchants marvelled at the abundance of his
      generosity and openhandedness. Then he turned to another trader and borrowing of him other thousand ducats, gave
      these also away, while Merchant Ali looked on at what he did, but could not speak. He ceased not to do thus till
      the call to mid-afternoon prayer, when he entered the mosque and prayed and distributed the rest of the money. On
      this wise, by the time they locked the doors of the bazar, he had borrowed five thousand sequins and given them
      away, saying to every one of whom he took aught, "Wait till my baggage come when, if you desire gold I will give
      you gold, and if you desire stuffs, you shalt have stuffs; for I have no end of them." At eventide Merchant Ali
      invited Ma'aruf and the rest of the traders to an entertainment and seated him in the upper end, the place of
      honour, where he talked of nothing but cloths and jewels, and whenever they made mention to him of aught, he said,
      "I have plenty of it." Next day, he again repaired to the market-street where he showed a friendly bias towards
      the merchants and borrowed of them more money, which he distributed to the poor: nor did he leave doing thus
      twenty days, till he had borrowed threescore thousand dinars, and still there came no baggage, no, nor a burning
      plague. At last folk began to clamour for their money and say, "The merchant Ma'aruf's baggage cometh not. How
      long will he take people's monies and give them to the poor?" And said one of them, "My rede is that we speak to
      Merchant Ali." So they went to him and said, "O Merchant Ali, Merchant Ma'aruf's baggage cometh not." Said he,
      "Have patience, it cannot fail to come soon." Then he took Ma'aruf aside and said to him, "O Ma'aruf, what fashion
      is this? Did I bid you brown the bread or burn it? The merchants clamour for their coin and tell me that thou
      owest them sixty thousand dinars, which you has borrowed and given away to the poor. How wilt you satisfy the
      folk, seeing that you neither sellest nor buyest?" Said Ma'aruf, "What matters it; and what are threescore
      thousand dinars? When my baggage shall come, I will pay them in stuffs or in gold and silver, as they will." said
      Merchant Ali, "Allah is Most Great! has you then any baggage?"; and he said, "Plenty." Cried the other, "Allah
      and the Hallows requite you thine impudence! Did I teach you this saying, that you shouldst repeat it to me?
      But I will acquaint the folk with you." Ma'aruf rejoined, "Begone and prate no more! Am I a poor man? I have
      endless wealth in my baggage and as soon as it cometh, they shall have their money's worth two for one. I have no
      need of them." At this Merchant Ali waxed wroth and said, "Unmannerly wight that you art, I will teach you to
      lie to me and be not ashamed!" Said Ma'aruf, "E'en work the worst thy hand can do! They must wait till my baggage
      come, when they shall have their due and more." So Ali left him and went away, saying in himself, "I praised him
      whilome and if I blame him now, I make myself out a liar and become of those of whom it is said:- -Whoso praised
      and then blamed lieth twice." And he knew not what to do. Presently, the traders came to him and said, "O
      Merchant Ali, has you spoken to him?" Said he, "O folk, I am ashamed and, though he owe me a thousand dinars, I
      cannot speak to him. When ye lent him your money ye consulted me not; so ye have no claim on me. Dun him
      yourselves, and if he pay you not, complain of him to the King of the city, saying:—He is an impostor who hath
      imposed upon us. And he will deliver you from the plague of him." Accordingly, they repaired to the King and told
      him what had passed, saying, "O King of the age, we are perplexed anent this merchant, whose generosity is
      excessive; for he did thus and thus, and all he borrowed, he gave away to the poor by handsful. Were he a man
      of naught, his sense would not suffer him to lavish gold on this wise; and were he a man of wealth, his good faith
      had been made manifest to us by the coming of his baggage; but we see none of his luggage, although he avoucheth
      that he hath baggage-train and hath preceded it. Now some time hath past, but there appeared no sign of his
      baggage-train, and he owed us sixty thousand gold pieces, all of which he hath given away in alms." And they went
      on to praise him and extol his generosity. Now this King was a very covetous man, a more covetous than Ash'ab; and
      when he heard tell of Ma'aruf's generosity and openhandedness, greed of gain got the better of him and he said to
      his Wazir, "Were not this merchant a man of immense wealth, he had not shown all this munificence. His
      baggage-train will assuredly come, whereupon these merchants will flock to him and he will scatter amongst them
      riches galore. Now I have more right to this money than they; wherefore I have a mind to make friends with him and
      profess affection for him, so that, when his baggage came whatso the merchants would have had I shall get of
      him; and I will give him my daughter to wife and join his wealth to my wealth." Replied the Wazir, "O King of the
      age, methinks he is naught but an impostor, and 'tis the impostor who ruined the house of the covetous;"—And
      Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</p>
    <p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir said to the King, "Methinks he is naught
      but an impostor, and 'tis the impostor who ruined the house of the covetous;" the King said, "O Wazir, I will
      prove him and soon know if he be an impostor or a true man and whether he be a rearling of Fortune or not." The
      Wazir asked, "And how wilt you prove him?"; and the King answered, "I will send for him to the presence and
      entreat him with honour and give him a jewel which I have. An he know it and wot its price, he is a man of worth
      and wealth; but an he know it not, he is an impostor and an upstart and I will do him die by the foulest fashion
      of deaths." So he sent for Ma'aruf, who came and saluted him. The King returned his salam and seating him beside
      himself, said to him, "Art you the merchant Ma'aruf?" and said he, "Yes." said the King, "The merchants declare
      that you owest them sixty thousand ducats. Is this true?" "Yes," said he. Asked the King, "Then why dost thou
      not give them their money?"; and he answered, "Let them wait till my baggage come and I will repay them twofold.
      An they wish for gold, they shall have gold; and should they wish for silver, they shall have silver; or an they
      prefer for merchandise, I will give them merchandise; and to whom I owe a thousand I will give two thousand in
      requital of that wherewith he hath veiled my face before the poor; for I have plenty." Then said the King, "O
      merchant, take this and look what is its kind and value." And he gave him a jewel the bigness of a hazel-nut,
      which he had bought for a thousand sequins and not having its fellow, prized it highly. Ma'aruf took it and
      pressing it between his thumb and forefinger brake it, for it was brittle and would not brook the squeeze. said
      the King, "Why has you broken the jewel?"; and Ma'aruf laughed and said, "O King of the age, this is no jewel.
      This is but a bittock of mineral worth a thousand dinars; why dost you style it a jewel? A jewel I call such as
      is worth threescore and ten thousand gold pieces and this is called but a piece of stone. A jewel that is not of
      the bigness of a walnut hath no worth in my eyes and I take no account thereof. How came it, then, that thou,
      who art King, stylest this thing a jewel, when 'tis but a bit of mineral worth a thousand dinars? But ye are
      excusable, for that ye are poor folk and have not in your possession things of price." The King asked, "O
      merchant, has you jewels such as those whereof you spoke?"; and he answered, "Plenty." Whereupon avarice
      overcame the King and he said, "Wilt you give me real jewels?" Said Ma'aruf, "When my baggage-train shall come, I
      will give you no end of jewels; and all that you canst desire I have in plenty and will give you, without
      price." At this the King rejoiced and said to the traders, "Wend your ways and have patience with him, till his
      baggage arrive, when do ye come to me and receive your monies from me." So they fared forth and the King turned to
      his to his Wazir and said to him, Pay court to Merchant Ma'aruf and take and give with him in talk and bespeak him
      of my daughter, Princess Dunyá, that he may wed her and so we gain these riches he hath." Said the Wazir, "O King
      of the age, this man's fashion misliketh me and methinks he is an impostor and a liar: so leave this whereof thou
      speakest lest you lose thy daughter for naught." Now this Minister had sued the King aforetime to give him his
      daughter to wife and he was willing to do so, but when she heard of it she consented not to marry him.
      Accordingly, the King said to him, "O traitor, you desirest no good for me, because in past time you soughtest
      my daughter in wedlock, but she would none of you; so now you would cut off the way of her marriage and
      would have the Princess lie fallow, that you mayst take her; but hear from me one word. you has no concern in
      this matter. How can he be an impostor and a liar, seeing that he knew the price of the jewel, even that for which
      I bought it, and brake it because it pleased him not? He hath jewels in plenty, and when he goeth in to my
      daughter and seeth her to be beautiful she will captivate his reason and he will love her and give her jewels and
      things of price: but, as for you, you would forbid my daughter and myself these good things." So the Minister
      was silent, for fear of the King's anger, and said to himself, "Set the curs on the cattle!" Then with show of
      friendly bias he betook himself to Ma'aruf and said to him, "His Highness the King loved you and hath a
      daughter, a winsome lady and a lovesome, to whom he is minded to marry you. What sayst thou?" Said he, "No harm
      in that; but let him wait till my baggage come, for marriage-settlements on Kings' daughters are large and their
      rank demanded that they be not endowed save with a dowry befitting their degree. At this present I have no money
      with me till the coming of my baggage, for I have wealth in plenty and needs must I make her marriage-portion five
      thousand purses. Then I shall need a thousand purses to distribute amongst the poor and needy on my wedding-night,
      and other thousand to give to those who walk in the bridal procession and yet other thousand wherewith to provide
      provaunt for the troops and others; and I shall want an hundred jewels to give to the Princess on the
      wedding-morning and other hundred gems to distribute among the slavegirls and eunuchs, for I must give each of
      them a jewel in honour of the bride; and I need wherewithal to clothe a thousand naked paupers, and alms too needs
      must be given. All this cannot be done till my baggage come; but I have plenty and, once it is here, I shall make
      no account of all this outlay." The Wazir returned to the King and told him what Ma'aruf said, whereupon said he,
      "Since this is his wish, how canst you style him impostor and liar?" Replied the Minister, "And I cease not to
      say this." But the King chid him angrily and threatened him, saying, "By the life of my head, an you cease not
      this talk, I will slay you! Go back to him and fetch him to me and I will manage matters with him myself." So the
      Wazir returned to Ma'aruf and said to him, "Come and speak with the King." "I hear and I obey," said Ma'aruf and
      went in to the King, who said to him, "you shalt not put me off with these excuses, for my treasury is full; so
      take the keys and spend all you needest and give what you wilt and clothe the poor and do thy desire and have no
      care for the girl and the handmaids. When the baggage shall come, do what you wilt with thy wife, by way of
      generosity, and we will have patience with you anent the marriage-portion till then, for there is no manner of
      difference betwixt me and you; none at all." Then he sent for the Shaykh Al-Islam and bade him write out the
      marriage-contract between his daughter and Merchant Ma'aruf, and he did so; after which the King gave the signal
      for beginning the wedding festivities and bade decorate the city. The kettle drums beat and the tables were spread
      with meats of all kinds and there came performers who paraded their tricks. Merchant Ma'aruf sat upon a throne in
      a parlour and the players and gymnasts and effeminates and dancing-men of wondrous movements and posture-makers of
      marvellous cunning came before him, while he called out to the treasurer and said to him, "Bring gold and
      silver." So he brought gold and silver and Ma'aruf went round among the spectators and largessed each performer by
      the handful; and he gave alms to the poor and needy and clothes to the naked and it was a clamorous festival and a
      right merry. The treasurer could not bring money fast enough from the treasury, and the Wazir's heart was like to
      burst for rage; but he dared not say a word, while Merchant Ali marvelled at this waste of wealth and said to
      Merchant Ma'aruf, "Allah and the Hallows visit this upon on thy head-sides! Doth it not suffice you to squander
      the traders' money, but you must squander that of the King to boot?" Replied Ma'aruf, "'Tis none of thy concern:
      whenas my baggage shall come, I will requite the King manifold." And he went on lavishing money and saying in
      himself, "A burning plague! What will happen will happen and there is no flying from that which is fore-ordained."
      The festivities ceased not for the space of forty days, and on the one-and-fortieth day, they made the bride's
      cortège and all the Emirs and troops walked before her. When they brought her in before Ma'aruf, he began
      scattering gold on the people's heads, and they made her a mighty fine procession, while Ma'aruf expended in her
      honour vast sums of money. Then they brought him in to Princess Dunya and he sat down on the high divan; after
      which they let fall the curtains and shut the doors and withdrew, leaving him alone with his bride; whereupon he
      smote hand upon hand and sat awhile sorrowful and saying, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
      Allah, the Glorious, the Great!" said the Princess, "O my lord, Allah preserve you! What aileth you that thou
      art troubled?" said he, "And how should I be other than troubled, seeing that thy father hath embarrassed me and
      done with me a deed which is like the burning of green corn?" She asked, "And what hath my father done with you?
      Tell me!"; and he answered, "He hath brought me in to you before the coming of my baggage, and I want at very
      least an hundred jewels to distribute among thy handmaids, to each a jewel, so she might rejoice therein and say,
      My lord gave me a jewel on the night of his going in to my lady. This good deed would I have done in honour of thy
      station and for the increase of thy dignity; and I have no need to stint myself in lavishing jewels, for I have of
      them great plenty." Rejoined she, "Be not concerned for that. As for me, trouble not thyself about me, for I will
      have patience with you till thy baggage shall come, and as for my women have no care for them. Rise, doff thy
      clothes and take thy pleasure; and when the baggage cometh we shall get the jewels and the rest." So he arose and
      putting off his clothes sat down on the bed and sought love-liesse and they fell to toying with each other. He
      laid his hand on her knee and she sat down in his lap and thrust her lip like a tit-bit of meat into his mouth,
      and that hour was such as maketh a man to forget his father and his mother. So he clasped her in his arms and
      strained her fast to his breast and sucked her lip, till the honey-dew ran out into his mouth; and he laid his
      hand under her left-armpit, whereupon his vitals and her vitals yearned for coition. Then he clapped her between
      the breasts and his hand slipped down between her thighs and she girded him with her legs, whereupon he made of
      the two parts proof amain and crying out, "O sire of the chin-veils twain!" applied the priming and kindled the
      match and set it to the touch-hole and gave fire and breached the citadel in its four corners; so there befel the
      mystery concerning which there is no enquiry: and she cried the cry that needs must be cried.—And Shahrazad
      perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</p>
    <p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while the Princess Dunyá cried the cry which must be
      cried, Merchant Ma'aruf abated her maidenhead and that night was one not to be counted among lives for that which
      it comprised of the enjoyment of the fair, clipping and dallying <i>langue fourrée</i> and futtering till the dawn
      of day, when he arose and entered the Hammam whence, after donning a suit for sovrans suitable he betook himself
      to the King's Divan. All who were there rose to him and received him with honour and worship, giving him joy and
      invoking blessings upon him; and he sat down by the King's side and asked, "Where is the treasurer?" They
      answered, "Here he is, before you," and he said to him, "Bring robes of honour for all the Wazirs and Emirs and
      dignitaries and clothe them therewith." The treasurer brought him all he sought and he sat giving to all who came
      to him and lavishing largesse upon every man according to his station. On this wise he abode twenty days, while
      no baggage appeared for him nor aught else, till the treasurer was straitened by him to the uttermost and going in
      to the King, as he sat alone with the Wazir in Ma'aruf's absence, kissed ground between his hands and said, "O
      King of the age, I must tell you somewhat, lest haply you blame me for not acquainting you therewith. Know that
      the treasury is being exhausted; there is none but a little money left in it and in ten days more we shall shut it
      upon emptiness." said the King, "O Wazir, verily my son-in-law's baggage-train tarried long and there appeareth
      no news thereof." The Minister laughed and said , Allah be gracious to you, O King of the age! you art none
      other but heedless with respect to this impostor, this liar. As thy head liveth, there is no baggage for him, no,
      nor a burning plague to rid us of him! Nay, he hath but imposed on you without surcease, so that he hath wasted
      thy treasures and married thy daughter for naught. How long therefore wilt you be heedless of this liar?" Then
      said the King, "O Wazir, how shall we do to learn the truth of his case?"; and said the Wazir, "O King of the
      age, none may come at a man's secret but his wife; so send for thy daughter and let her come behind the curtain,
      that I may question her of the truth of his estate, to the intent that she may make question of him and acquaint
      us with his case." Cried the King, "There is no harm in that; and as my head liveth, if it be proved that he is a
      liar and an impostor, I will verily do him die by the foulest of deaths!" Then he carried the Wazir into the
      sitting-chamber and sent for his daughter, who came behind the curtain, her husband being absent, and said, "What
      would thou, O my father?" Said he "Speak with the Wazir." So she asked, "Ho thou, the Wazir, what is thy will?";
      and he answered, "O my lady, you must know that thy husband hath squandered thy father's substance and married
      you without a dower; and he ceased not to promise us and break his promises, nor cometh there any tidings of his
      baggage; in short we would have you inform us concerning him." said she, "Indeed his words be many, and he still
      cometh and promised me jewels and treasures and costly stuffs; but I see nothing." said the Wazir, "O my lady,
      canst you this night take and give with him in talk and whisper to him:—Say me sooth and fear from me naught, for
      you art become my husband and I will not transgress against you. So tell me the truth of the matter and I will
      devise you a device whereby you shalt be set at rest. And do you play near and far with him in words and
      profess love to him and win him to confess and after tell us the facts of his case." And she answered, "O my papa,
      I know how I will make proof of him." Then she went away and after supper her husband came in to her, according to
      his wont, whereupon Princess Dunya rose to him and took him under the armpit and wheedled him with winsomest
      wheedling (and all-sufficient are woman's wiles whenas she would aught of men); and she ceased not to caress him
      and beguile him with speech sweeter than the honey till she stole his reason; and when she saw that he altogether
      inclined to her, she said to him, "O my beloved, O coolth of my eyes and fruit of my vitals, Allah never desolate
      me by less of you nor Time sunder us twain me and you! Indeed, the love of you hath homed in my heart and the
      fire of passion hath consumed my liver, nor will I ever forsake you or transgress against you. But I would have
      you tell me the truth, for that the sleights of falsehood profit not, nor do they secure credit at all seasons.
      How long wilt you impose upon my father and lie to him? I fear lest thine affair be discovered to him, ere we can
      devise some device and he lay violent hands upon you? So acquaint me with the facts of the case for naught shall
      befal you save that which shall begladden you; and, when you shalt have spoken sooth, fear not harm shall
      betide you. How often wilt you declare that you art a merchant and a man of money and has a luggage-train?
      This long while past you sayest, My baggage! my baggage! but there appeared no sign of thy baggage, and visible
      in thy face is anxiety on this account. So an there be no worth in thy words, tell me and I will contrive you a
      contrivance whereby by you shalt come off safe, Inshallah!" He replied, "I will tell you the truth, and then do
      you whatso you wilt." Rejoined she, "Speak and look you speak soothly; for sooth is the ark of safety, and
      beware of lying, for it dishonoured the liar and God-gifted is he who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>'Ware that truth you speak, albe sooth when said * Shall cause<br />
             you in threatenèd fire to fall:<br />
        And seek Allah's approof, for most foolish he * Who shall anger<br />
             his Lord to make friends with thrall."<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>He said, "Know, then, O my lady, that I am no merchant and have no baggage, no, nor a burning plague; nay, I was
      but a cobbler in my own country and had a wife called Fatimah the Dung, with whom there befel me this and that."
      And he told her his story from beginning to end; whereat she laughed and said, "Verily, you art clever in the
      practice of lying and imposture!" Whereto he answered, "O my lady, may Allah Almighty preserve you to veil sins
      and countervail chagrins!" Rejoined she, "Know, that you imposedst upon my sire and deceivedst him by dint of thy
      deluding vaunts, so that of his greed for gain he married me to you. Then you squanderedst his wealth and the
      Wazir bears you a grudge for this. How many a time hath he spoken against you to my father, saying, Indeed, he
      is an impostor, a liar! But my sire hearkened not to his say, for that he had sought me in wedlock and I consented
      not that he be baron and I femme. However, the time grew longsome upon my sire and he became straitened and said
      to me, Make him confess. So I have made you confess and that which was covered is discovered. Now my father
      purposed you a mischief because of this; but you art become my husband and I will never transgress against
      you. An I told my father what I have learnt from you, he would be certified of thy falsehood and imposture and
      that you imposest upon Kings' daughters and squanderest royal wealth: so would thine offence find with him no
      pardon and he would slay you sans a doubt: wherefore it would be bruited among the folk that I married a man who
      was a liar, an impostor, and this would smirch mine honour. Furthermore an he kill you, most like he will require
      me to wed another, and to such thing I will never consent; no, not though I die! So rise now and don a Mameluke's
      dress and take these fifty thousand dinars of my monies, and mount a swift steed and get you to a land whither
      the rule of my father doth not reach. Then make you a merchant and send me a letter by a courier who shall bring
      it privily to me, that I may know in what land you art, so I may send you all my hand can attain. Thus shall thy
      wealth wax great and if my father die, I will send for you, and you shalt return in respect and honour; and if
      we die, you or I and go to the mercy of God the Most Great, the Resurrection shall unite us. This, then, is the
      rede that is right: and while we both abide alive and well, I will not cease to send you letters and monies.
      Arise ere the day wax bright and you be in perplexed plight and perdition upon thy head alight!" said he, "O my
      lady, I beseech you of thy favour to bid me farewell with thine embracement;" and said she, "No harm in that."
      So he embraced her and knew her carnally; after which he made the Ghusl-ablution; then, donning the dress of a
      white slave, he bade the syces saddle him a thoroughbred steed. Accordingly, they saddled him a courser and he
      mounted and farewelling his wife, rode forth the city at the last of the night, while all who saw him deemed him
      one of the Mamelukes of the Sultan going abroad on some business. Next morning, the King and his Wazir repaired to
      the sitting-chamber and sent for Princess Dunya who came behind the curtain; and her father said to her, "O my
      daughter, what sayst thou?" Said she, "I say, Allah blacken thy Wazir's face, because he would have blackened my
      face in my husband's eyes!" Asked the King, "How so?"; and she answered, "He came in to me yesterday; but, before
      I could name the matter to him, behold, in walked Faraj the Chief Eunuch, letter in hand, and said:—Ten white
      slaves stand under the palace window and have this letter, saying:—Kiss for us the hands of our lord, Merchant
      Ma'aruf, and give him this letter, for we are of his Mamelukes with the baggage, and it hath reached us that he
      hath wedded the King's daughter, so we are come to acquaint him with that which befel us by the way. Accordingly I
      took the letter and read as follows:—From the five hundred Mamelukes to his highness our lord Merchant Ma'aruf.
      But further. We give you to know that, after you quittedst us, the Arabs came out upon us and attacked us. They
      were two thousand horse and we five hundred mounted slaves and there befel a mighty sore fight between us and
      them. They hindered us from the road thirty days doing battle with them and this is the cause of our tarrying from
      you."—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Dunya said to her sire, "My husband received a
      letter from his dependents ending with:—The Arabs hindered us from the road thirty days which is the cause of our
      being behind time. They also took from us of the luggage two hundred loads of cloth and slew of us fifty
      Mamelukes. When the news reached my husband, he cried, Allah disappoint them! What ailed them to wage war with the
      Arabs for the sake of two hundred loads of merchandise? What are two hundred loads? It behoved them not to tarry
      on that account, for verily the value of the two hundred loads is only some seven thousand dinars. But needs must
      I go to them and hasen them. As for that which the Arabs have taken, 'twill not be missed from the baggage, nor
      doth it weigh with me a whit, for I reckon it as if I had given it to them by way of an alms. Then he went down
      from me, laughing and taking no concern for the wastage of his wealth nor the slaughter of his slaves. As soon as
      he was gone, I looked out from the lattice and saw the ten Mamelukes who had brought him the letter, as they were
      moons, each clad in a suit of clothes worth two thousand dinars, there is not with my father a chattel to match
      one of them. He went forth with them to bring up his baggage and hallowed be Allah who hindered me from saying to
      him aught of that you badest me, for he would have made mock of me and you, and haply he would have eyed me with
      the eye of disparagement and hated me. But the fault is all with thy Wazir, who spoke against my husband words
      that besit him not." Replied the King, "O my daughter, thy husband's wealth is indeed endless and he recked not
      of it; for, from the day he entered our city, he hath done naught but give alms to the poor. Inshallah, he will
      speedily return with the baggage, and good in plenty shall betide us from him." And he went on to appease her and
      menace the Wazir, being duped by her device. So fared it with the King; but as regards Merchant Ma'aruf he rode on
      into waste lands, perplexed and knowing not to what quarter he should betake him; and for the anguish of parting
      he lamented and in the pangs of passion and love-longing he recited these couplets:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>Time falsed our Union and divided who were one in tway; * And the<br />

        O favour like the full moon's face of sheen, indeed I'm he * Whom<br />

    <p>And when he ended his verses, he wept with sore weeping, for indeed the ways were walled up before his face and
      death seemed to him better than dreeing life, and he walked on like a drunken man for stress of distraction, and
      stayed not till noontide, when he came to a little town and saw a plougher hard by, ploughing with a yoke of
      bulls. Now hunger was sore upon him; and he went up to the ploughman and said to him, "Peace be with you!"; and
      he returned his salam and said to him, "Welcome, O my lord! Art you one of the Sultan's Mamelukes?" said
      Ma'aruf, "Yes;" and the other said "Alight with me for a guest-meal." Whereupon Ma'aruf knew him to be of the
      liberal and said to him, "O my brother, I see with you naught with which you mayst feed me: how is it, then,
      that you invitest me?" Answered the husbandman, "O my lord, weal is well nigh. Dismount you here: the town is
      near hand and I will go and fetch you dinner and fodder for thy stallion." Rejoined Ma'aruf, "Since the town is
      near at hand, I can go thither as quickly as you canst and buy me what I have a mind to in the bazar and eat."
      The peasant replied, "O my lord, the place is but a little village and there is no bazar there, neither selling
      nor buying. So I conjure you by Allah, alight here with me and hearten my heart, and I will run thither and
      return to you in hase." Accordingly he dismounted and the Fellah left him and went off to the village, to fetch
      dinner for him while Ma'aruf sat awaiting him. Presently he said in himself, "I have taken this poor man away
      from his work; but I will arise and plough in his stead, till he come back, to make up for having hindered him
      from his work." Then he took the plough and starting the bulls, ploughed a little, till the share struck against
      something and the beasts stopped. He goaded them on, but they could not move the plough; so he looked at the share
      and finding it caught in a ring of gold, cleared away the soil and saw that it was set centre-most a slab of
      alabaster, the size of the nether millstone. He strave at the stone till he pulled it from its place, when there
      appeared beneath it a souterrain with a stair. Presently he descended the flight of steps and came to a place like
      a Hammam, with four daïses, the first full of gold, from floor to roof, the second full of emeralds and pearls and
      coral also from ground to ceiling; the third of jacinths and rubies and turquoises and the fourth of diamonds and
      all manner other preciousest stones. At the upper end of the place stood a coffer of clearest crystal, full of
      union-gems each the size of a walnut, and upon the coffer lay a casket of gold, the bigness of a lemon. When he
      saw this, he marvelled and rejoiced with joy exceeding and said to himself, "I wonder what is in this casket?" So
      he opened it and found therein a seal-ring of gold, whereon were graven names and talismans, as they were the
      tracks of creeping ants. He rubbed the ring and behold, a voice said, "Adsum! Here am I, at thy service, O my
      lord! Ask and it shall be given unto you. Wilt you raise a city or ruin a capital or kill a king or dig a
      river-channel or aught of the kind? Whatso you seekest, it shall come to pass, by leave of the King of All-might,
      Creator of day and night." Ma'aruf asked, "O creature of my lord, who and what art thou?"; and the other answered,
      "I am the slave of this seal-ring standing in the service of him who possessed it. Whatsoever he seeketh, that I
      accomplish for him, and I have no excuse in neglecting that he bidd me do; because I am Sultan over
      two-and-seventy tribes of the Jinn, each two-and-seventy thousand in number every one of which thousand ruleth
      over a thousand Marids, each Marid over a thousand Ifrits, each Ifrit over a thousand Satans and each Satan over a
      thousand Jinn: and they are all under command of me and may not gainsay me. As for me, I am spelled to this
      seal-ring and may not thwart whoso held it. Lo! you has gotten hold of it and I am become thy slave; so ask
      what you wilt, for I hearken to thy word and obey thy bidding; and if you have need of me at any time, by land
      or by sea rub the signet-ring and you wilt find me with you. But beware of rubbing it twice in succession, or
      you wilt consume me with the fire of the names graven thereon; and thus would you lose me and after regret me.
      Now I have acquainted you with my case and—the Peace!"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
      her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,</p>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Slave of the Signet-ring acquainted Ma'aruf
      with his case, the Merchant asked him, "What is thy name?" and the Jinni answered, "My name is Abú al-Sa'ádát."
      said Ma'aruf, "O Abú al-Sa'ádát what is this place and who enchanted you in this casket?"; and said he, "O my
      lord, this is a treasure called the Hoard of Shaddád son of Ad, him who the base of Many-columned Iram laid, the
      like of which in the lands was never made.' I was his slave in his lifetime and this is his seal-ring, which he
      laid up in his treasure; but it hath fallen to thy lot." Ma'aruf enquired, "Canst you transport that which is in
      this hoard to the surface of the earth?"; and the Jinni replied, "Yes! Nothing were easier." Said Ma'aruf, "Bring
      it forth and leave naught." So the Jinni signed with his hand to the ground, which clave asunder, and he sank and
      was absent a little while. Presently, there came forth young boys full of grace, and fair of face bearing golden
      baskets filled with gold which they emptied out and going away, returned with more; nor did they cease to
      transport the gold and jewels, till ere an hour had sped they said, "Naught is left in the hoard." Thereupon out
      came Abú al-Sa'ádát and said to Ma'aruf, "O my lord, you seest that we have brought forth all that was in the
      hoard." Ma'aruf asked, "Who be these beautiful boys?" and the Jinni answered, "They are my sons. This matter
      merited not that I should muster for it the Marids, wherefore my sons have done thy desire and are honoured by
      such service. So ask what you wilt beside this." said Ma'aruf, "Canst you bring me he-mules and chests and fill
      the chests with the treasure and load them on the mules?" said Abú al-Sa'ádát, "Nothing easier," and cried a
      great cry; whereupon his sons presented themselves before him, to the number of eight hundred, and he said to
      them, "Let some of you take the semblance of he-mules and others of muleteers and handsome Mamelukes, the like of
      the least of whom is not found with any of the Kings; and others of you be transmewed to muleteers, and the rest
      to menials." So seven hundred of them changed themselves into bât-mules and other hundred took the shape of
      slaves. Then Abú al-Sa'ádát called upon his Marids, who presented themselves between his hands and he commanded
      some of them to assume the aspect of horses saddled with saddles of gold crusted with jewels. And when Ma'aruf saw
      them do as he bade he cried, "Where be the chests?" They brought them before him and he said, "Pack the gold and
      the stones, each sort by itself." So they packed them and loaded three hundred he-mules with them. Then asked
      Ma'aruf, "O Abú al-Sa'ádát, canst you bring me some loads of costly stuffs?"; and the Jinni answered, "Wilt thou
      have Egyptian stuffs or Syrian or Persian or Indian or Greek?" Ma'aruf said, "Bring me an hundred loads of each
      kind, on five hundred mules;" and Abú al-Sa'ádát, "O my lord accord me delay that I may dispose my Marids for this
      and send a company of them to each country to fetch an hundred loads of its stuffs and then take the form of
      he-mules and return, carrying the stuffs." Ma'aruf enquired, "What time dost you want?"; and Abú al-Sa'ádát
      replied, "The time of the blackness of the night, and day shall not dawn ere you have all you desirest." Said
      Ma'aruf, "I grant you this time," and bade them pitch him a pavilion. So they pitched it and he sat down therein
      and they brought him a table of food. Then said Abú al-Sa'ádát to him, "O my lord, tarry you in this tent and
      these my sons shall guard you: so fear you nothing; for I go to muster my Marids and despatch them to do thy
      desire." So saying, he departed, leaving Ma'aruf seated in the pavilion, with the table before him and the Jinni's
      sons attending upon him, in the guise of slaves and servants and suite. And while he sat in this state behold, up
      came the husband man, with a great porringer of lentils and a nose-bag full of barley and seeing the pavilion
      pitched and the Mamelukes standing, hands upon breasts, thought that the Sultan was come and had halted on that
      stead. So he stood openmouthed and said in himself, "Would I had killed a couple of chickens and fried them red
      with clarified cow-butter for the Sultan!" And he would have turned back to kill the chickens as a regale for the
      Sultan; but Ma'aruf saw him and cried out to him and said to the Mamelukes, "Bring him hither." So they brought
      him and his porringer of lentils before Ma'aruf, who said to him, "What is this?" Said the peasant, "This is thy
      dinner and thy horse's fodder! Excuse me, for I thought not that the Sultan would come hither; and, had I known
      that, I would have killed a couple of chickens and entertained him in goodly guise." said Ma'aruf, "The Sultan is
      not come. I am his son-in-law and I was vexed with him. However he hath sent his officers to make his peace with
      me, and now I am minded to return to city. But you has made me this guest-meal without knowing me, and I accept
      it from you, lentils though it be, and will not eat save of thy cheer." Accordingly he bade him set the porringer
      amiddlemost the table and ate of it his sufficiency, while the Fellah filled his belly with those rich meats.
      Then Ma'aruf washed his hands and gave the Mamelukes leave to eat; so they fell upon the remains of the meal and
      ate; and, when the porringer was empty, he filled it with gold and gave it to the peasant, saying, "Carry this to
      thy dwelling and come to me in the city, and I will entreat you with honour." Thereupon the peasant took the
      porringer full of gold and returned to the village, driving the bulls before him and deeming himself akin to the
      King. Meanwhile, they brought Ma'aruf girls of the Brides of the Treasure, who smote on instruments of music and
      danced before him, and he passed that night in joyance and delight, a night not to be reckoned among lives. Hardly
      had dawned the day when there arose a great cloud of dust which presently lifting, discovered seven hundred mules
      laden with stuffs and attended by muleteers and baggage-tenders and cresset-bearers. With them came Abú
      al-Sa'ádát, riding on a she-mule, in the guise of a caravan-leader, and before him was a travelling-litter, with
      four corner-terminals of glittering red gold, set with gems. When Abú al-Sa'ádát came up to the tent, he
      dismounted and kissing the earth, said to Ma'aruf, "O my lord, thy desire hath been done to the uttermost and in
      the litter is a treasure-suit which hath not its match among Kings' raiment: so don it and mount the litter and
      bid us do what you wilt." said Ma'aruf, "O Abú al-Sa'ádát, I wish you to go to the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khatan
      and present thyself to my father-in-law the King; and go you not in to him but in the guise of a mortal courier;"
      and said he, "To hear is to obey." So Ma'aruf wrote a letter to the Sultan and sealed it and Abú al-Sa'ádát took
      it and set out with it; and when he arrived, he found the King saying, "O Wazir, indeed my heart is concerned for
      my son-in-law and I fear lest the Arabs slay him. Would Heaven I wot whither he was bound, that I might have
      followed him with the troops! Would he had told me his destination!" Said the Wazir, "Allah be merciful to you
      for this thy heedlessness! As thy head liveth, the wight saw that we were awake to him and feared dishonour and
      fled, for he is nothing but an impostor, a liar." And behold, at this moment in came the courier and kissing
      ground before the King, wished him permanent glory and prosperity and length of life. Asked the King, "Who art
      you and what is thy business?" "I am a courier," answered the Jinni, "and thy son-in-law who is come with the
      baggage sendeth me to you with a letter, and here it is!" So he took the letter and read therein these words,
      "After salutations galore to our uncle the glorious King! Know that I am at hand with the baggage-train: so come
      you forth to meet me with the troops." Cried the King, "Allah blacken thy brow, O Wazir! How often wilt thou
      defame my son-in-law's name and call him liar and impostor? Behold, he is come with the baggage-train and you art
      naught but a traitor." The Minister hung his head ground-wards in shame and confusion and replied, "O King of the
      age, I said not this save because of the long delay of the baggage and because I feared the loss of the wealth he
      hath wasted." The King exclaimed, "O traitor, what are my riches! Now that his baggage is come he will give me
      great plenty in their stead." Then he bade decorate the city and going in to his daughter, said to her, "Good news
      for you! Thy husband will be here anon with his baggage; for he hath sent me a letter to that effect and here am
      I now going forth to meet him." The Princess Dunyá marvelled at this and said in herself, "This is a wondrous
      thing! Was he laughing at me and making mock of me, or had he a mind to try me, when he told me that he was a
      pauper? But Alhamdolillah, Glory to God, for that I failed not of my duty to him!" On this wise fared it in the
      palace; but as regards Merchant Ali, the Cairene, when he saw the decoration of the city and asked the cause
      thereof, they said to him, "The baggage-train of Merchant Ma'aruf, the King's son-in-law, is come." Said he,
      "Allah is Almighty! What a calamity is this man! He came to me, fleeing from his wife, and he was a poor man.
      Whence then should he get a baggage-train? But haply this is a device which the King's daughter hath contrived for
      him, fearing his disgrace, and Kings are not unable to do anything. May Allah the Most High veil his fame and not
      bring him to public shame!"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,</p>
    <p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Merchant Ali asked the cause of the decorations,
      they told him the truth of the case; so he blessed Merchant Ma'aruf and cried, "May Allah Almighty veil his fame
      and not bring him to public shame!" And all the merchants rejoiced and were glad for that they would get their
      monies. Then the King assembled his troops and rode forth, while Abú al-Sa'ádát returned to Ma'aruf and
      acquainted him with the delivering of the letter. said Ma'aruf, "Bind on the loads;" and when they had done so,
      he donned the treasure-suit and mounting the litter became a thousand times greater and more majestic than the
      King. Then he set forward; but, when he had gone half-way, behold, the King met him with the troops, and seeing
      him riding in the Takhtrawan and clad in the dress aforesaid, threw himself upon him and saluted him, and giving
      him joy of his safety, greeted him with the greeting of peace. Then all the Lords of the land saluted him and it
      was made manifest that he had spoken the truth and that in him there was no lie. Presently he entered the city in
      such state procession as would have caused the gall-bladder of the lion to burst for envy and the traders pressed
      up to him and kissed his hands, while Merchant Ali said to him, "you has played off this trick and it hath
      prospered to thy hand, O Shaykh of Impostors! But you deservest it and may Allah the Most High increase you of
      His bounty!"; whereupon Ma'aruf laughed. Then he entered the palace and sitting down on the throne said, "Carry
      the loads of gold into the treasury of my uncle the King and bring me the bales of cloth." So they brought them to
      him and opened them before him, bale after bale, till they had unpacked the seven hundred loads, whereof he chose
      out the best and said, "Bear these to Princess Dunyá that she may distribute them among her slavegirls; and carry
      her also this coffer of jewels, that she may divide them among her handmaids and eunuchs." Then he proceeded to
      make over to the merchants in whose debt he was stuffs by way of payment for their arrears, giving him whose due
      was a thousand, stuffs worth two thousand or more; after which he fell to distributing to the poor and needy,
      while the King looked on with greedy eyes and could not hinder him; nor did he cease largesse till he had made an
      end of the seven hundred loads, when he turned to the troops and proceeded to apportion amongst them emeralds and
      rubies and pearls and coral and other jewels by handsful, without count, till the King said to him, "Enough of
      this giving, O my son! There is but little left of the baggage." But he said, "I have plenty." Then indeed, his
      good faith was become manifest and none could give him the lie; and he had come to reck not of giving, for that
      the Slave of the Seal-ring brought him whatsoever he sought. Presently, the treasurer came in to the King and
      said, "O King of the age, the treasury is full indeed and will not hold the rest of the loads. Where shall we lay
      that which is left of the gold and jewels?" And he assigned to him another place. As for the Princess Dunya when
      she saw this, her joy redoubled and she marvelled and said in herself, "Would I wot how came he by all this
      wealth!" In like manner the traders rejoiced in that which he had given them and blessed him; while Merchant Ali
      marvelled and said to himself, "I wonder how he hath lied and swindled, that he hath gotten him all these
      treasures? Had they come from the King's daughter, he had not wasted them on this wise! But how excellent is his
      saying who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>When the Kings' King giveth, in reverence pause * And venture not<br />
             to enquire the cause:<br />
        Allah gives His gifts unto whom He will, * So respect and abide<br />
             by His Holy Laws!"<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>So far concerning him; but as regards the King, he also marvelled with passing marvel at that which he saw of
      Ma'aruf's generosity and open-handedness in the largesse of wealth. Then the Merchant went in to his wife, who met
      him, smiling and laughing-lipped and kissed his hand, saying, "Didst you mock me or hadst you a mind to prove me
      with thy saying:—I am a poor man and a fugitive from my wife? Praised be Allah for that I failed not of my duty to
      you! For you art my beloved and there is none dearer to me than thou, whether you be rich or poor. But I would
      have you tell me what didst you design by these words." Said Ma'aruf, "I wished to prove you and see whether
      thy love were sincere or for the sake of wealth and the greed of worldly good. But now 'tis become manifest to me
      that thine affection is sincere and as you art a true woman, so welcome to you! I know thy worth." Then he went
      apart into a place by himself and rubbed the seal-ring, whereupon Abu al-Sa'adat presented himself and said to
      him, "Adsum, at thy service! Ask what you wilt." said Ma'aruf, "I want a treasure-suit and treasure-trinkets for
      my wife, including a necklace of forty unique jewels." said the Jinni, "To hear is to obey," and brought him what
      he sought, whereupon Ma'aruf dismissed him and carrying the dress and ornaments in to his wife, laid them before
      her and said, "Take these and put them on and welcome!" When she saw this, her wits fled for joy, and she found
      among the ornaments a pair of anklets of gold set with jewels of the handiwork of the magicians, and bracelets and
      earrings and a belt such as no money could buy. So she donned the dress and ornaments and said to Ma'aruf, "O my
      lord, I will treasure these up for holidays and festivals." But he answered, "Wear them always, for I have others
      in plenty." And when she put them on and her women beheld her, they rejoiced and bussed his hands. Then he left
      them and going apart by himself, rubbed the seal-ring whereupon its slave appeared and he said to him, "Bring me
      an hundred suits of apparel, with their ornaments of gold." "Hearing and obeying," answered Abu al-Sa'adat and
      brought him the hundred suits, each with its ornaments wrapped up within it. Ma'aruf took them and called aloud to
      the slave-girls, who came to him and he gave them each a suit: so they donned them and became like the black-eyed
      girls of Paradise, while the Princess Dunya shone amongst them as the moon among the stars. One of the handmaids
      told the King of this and he came in to his daughter and saw her and her women dazzling all who beheld them;
      whereat he wondered with passing wonderment. Then he went out and calling his Wazir, said to him, "O Wazir, such
      and such things have happened; what sayst you now of this affair?" Said he, "O King of the age, this be no
      merchant's fashion; for a merchant kept a piece of linen by him for years and sold it not but at a profit.
      How should a merchant have generosity such as this generosity, and whence should he get the like of these monies
      and jewels, of which but a slight matter is found with the Kings? So how should loads thereof be found with
      merchants? Needs must there be a cause for this; but, an you wilt hearken to me, I will make the truth of the
      case manifest to you." Answered the King, "O Wazir, I will do thy bidding." Rejoined the Minister, "Do thou
      foregather with thy son-in-law and make a show of affect to him and talk with him and say:—O my son-in-law, I have
      a mind to go, I and you and the Wazir but no more, to a flower-garden that we may take our pleasure there. When
      we come to the garden, we will set on the table wine, and I will ply him therewith and compel him to drink; for,
      when he shall have drunken, he will lose his reason and his judgment will forsake him. Then we will question him
      of the truth of his case and he will discover to us his secrets, for wine is a traitor and Allah-gifted is he who
      said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>When we drank the wine, and it crept its way * To the place of<br />
             Secrets, I cried, "O stay!"<br />
        In my fear lest its influence stint my wits * And my friends spy<br />
             matters that hidden lay.<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>When he hath told us the truth we shall ken his case and may deal with him as we will; because I fear for you
      the consequences of this his present fashion: haply he will covet the kingship and win over the troops by
      generosity and lavishing money and so depose you and take the kingdom from you." "True," answered the King.—And
      Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</p>
    <p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir devised this device the King said to him,
      "you has spoken sooth!"; and they passed the night on this agreement. And when morning morrowed the King went
      forth and sat in the guest-chamber, when lo, and behold! the grooms and serving-men came in to him in dismay.
      said he, "What hath befallen you?"; and said they, "O King of the age, the Syces curried the horses and foddered
      them and the he-mules which brought the baggage; but, when we arose in the morning, we found that thy son-in-law's
      Mamelukes had stolen the horses and mules. We searched the stables, but found neither horse nor mule; so we
      entered the lodging of the Mamelukes and found none there, nor know we how they fled." The King marvelled at this,
      unknowing that the horses and Mamelukes were all Ifrits, the subjects of the Slave of the Spell, and asked the
      grooms, "O accursed how could a thousand beasts and five hundred slaves and servants flee without your knowledge?"
      Answered they, "We know not how it happened," and he cried, "Go, and when your lord cometh forth of the Harim,
      tell him the case." So they went out from before the King and sat down bewildered, till Ma'aruf came out and,
      seeing them chagrined enquired of them, "What may be the matter?" They told him all that had happened and he said,
      "What is their worth that ye should be concerned for them? Wend your ways." And he sat laughing and was neither
      angry nor grieved concerning the case; whereupon the King looked in the Wazir's face and said to him, "What manner
      of man is this, with whom wealth is of no worth? Needs must there be a reason for this?" Then they talked with him
      awhile and the King said to him, "O my son-in-law, I have a mind to go, I, you and the Wazir, to a garden, where
      we may divert ourselves." "No harm in that," said Ma'aruf. So they went forth to a flower-garden, wherein every
      sort of fruit was of kinds twain and its waters were flowing and its trees towering and its birds carolling. There
      they entered a pavilion, whose sight did away sorrow from the soul, and sat talking, while the Minister
      entertained them with rare tales and quoted merry quips and mirth-provoking sayings and Ma'aruf attentively
      listened, till the time of dinner came, when they set on a tray of meats and a flagon of wine. When they had eaten
      and washed hands, the Wazir filled the cup and gave it to the King, who drank it off; then he filled a second and
      handed it to Ma'aruf, saying, "Take the cup of the drink to which Reason bowed neck in reverence." said Ma'aruf,
      "What is this, O Wazir?"; and said he, "This is the grizzled virgin and the old maid long kept at home, the giver
      of joy to hearts, whereof said the poet:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">

    <p>And he ceased not to egg him on to the drink, naming to him such of the virtues of wine as he thought well and
      reciting to him what occurred to him of poetry and pleasantries on the subject, till Ma'aruf addressed himself to
      sucking the cup-lips and cared no longer for aught else. The Wazir ceased not to fill for him and he to drink and
      enjoy himself and make merry, till his wits wandered and he could not distinguish right from wrong. When the
      Minister saw that drunkenness had attained in him to utterest and the bounds transgressed, he said to him, "By
      Allah, O Merchant Ma'aruf, I admire whence you gottest these jewels whose like the Kings of the Chosroës possess
      not! In all our lives never saw we a merchant that had heaped up riches like unto thine or more generous than
      thou, for thy doings are the doings of Kings and not merchants' doings. Wherefore, Allah upon you, do thou
      acquaint me with this, that I may know thy rank and condition." And he went on to test him with questions and
      cajole him, till Ma'aruf, being reft of reason, said to him, "I'm neither merchant nor King," and told him his
      whole story from first to last. Then said the Wazir, "I conjure you by Allah, O my lord Ma'aruf, show us the
      ring, that we may see its make." So, in his drunkenness, he pulled off the ring and said, "Take it and look upon
      it." The Minister took it and turning it over, said, "If I rub it, will its slave appear?" Replied Ma'aruf, "Yes.
      Rub it and he will appear to you, and do you divert thyself with the sight of him." Thereupon the Wazir rubbed
      the ring and behold forthright appeared the Jinni and said, "Adsum, at thy service, O my lord! Ask and it shall be
      given to you. Wilt you ruin a city or raise a capital or kill a king? Whatso you seekest, I will do for you,
      sans fail." The Wazir pointed to Ma'aruf and said, "Take up yonder wretch and cast him down in the most desolate
      of desert lands, where he shall find nothing to eat nor drink, so he may die of hunger and perish miserably, and
      none know of him." Accordingly, the Jinni snatched him up and flew with him betwixt heaven and earth, which when
      Ma'aruf saw, he made sure of destruction and wept and said, "O Abu al-Sa'adat, whither goest you with me?"
      Replied the Jinni, "I go to cast you down in the Desert Quarter, O ill-bred wight of gross wits. Shall one have
      the like of this talisman and give it to the folk to gaze at? Verily, you deservest that which hath befallen
      you; and but that I fear Allah, I would let you fall from a height of a thousand fathoms, nor shouldst thou
      reach the earth, till the winds had torn you to shreds." Ma'aruf was silent and did not again bespeak him till he
      reached the Desert Quarter and casting him down there, went away and left him in that horrible place.—And
      Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Slave of the Seal-ring took up Ma'aruf and cast him
      down in the Desert Quarter where he left him and went his ways. So much concerning him; but returning to the Wazir
      who was now in possession of the talisman, he said to the King, "How deemest you now? Did I not tell you that
      this fellow was a liar, an impostor, but you would not credit me?" Replied the King, "you wast in the right, O
      my Wazir, Allah grant you weal! But give me the ring, that I may solace myself with the sight." The Minister
      looked at him angrily and spat in his face, saying, "O lack-wits, how shall I give it to you and abide thy
      servant, after I am become thy master? But I will spare you no more on life." Then he rubbed the seal-ring and
      said to the Slave, "Take up this ill-mannered churl and cast him down by his son-in-law the swindler-man." So the
      Jinni took him up and flew off with him, whereupon said the King to him, "O creature of my Lord, what is my
      crime?" Abu al-Sa'adat replied, "That wot I not, but my master hath commanded me and I cannot cross whoso hath
      compassed the enchanted ring." Then he flew on with him, till he came to the Desert Quarter and, casting him down
      where he had cast Ma'aruf left him and returned. The King hearing Ma'aruf weeping, went up to him and acquainted
      him with his case; and they sat weeping over that which had befallen them and found neither meat nor drink.
      Meanwhile the Minister, after driving father-in-law and son-in-law from the country, went forth from the garden
      and summoning all the troops held a Divan, and told them what he had done with the King and Ma'aruf and acquainted
      them with the affair of the talisman, adding, "Unless ye make me Sultan over you, I will bid the Slave of the
      Seal-ring take you up one and all and cast you down in the Desert Quarter where you shall die of hunger and
      thirst." They replied, "Do us no damage, for we accept you as Sultan over us and will not anywise gainsay thy
      bidding." So they agreed, in their own despite, to his being Sultan over them, and he bestowed on them robes of
      honour, seeking all he had a mind to of Abu al-Sa'adat, who brought it to him forthwith. Then he sat down on the
      throne and the troops did homage to him; and he sent to Princess Dunya, the King's daughter, saying, "Make you
      ready, for I mean to come in unto you this night, because I long for you with love." When she heard this, she
      wept, for the case of her husband and father was grievous to her, and sent to him saying, "Have patience with me
      till my period of widowhood be ended: then draw up thy contract of marriage with me and go in to me according to
      law." But he sent back to say to her, "I know neither period of widowhood nor to delay have I a mood; and I need
      not a contract nor know I lawful from unlawful; but needs must I go in unto you this night." She answered him
      saying, "So be it, then, and welcome to you!"; but this was a trick on her part. When the answer reached the
      Wazir, he rejoiced and his breast was broadened, for that he was passionately in love with her. He bade set food
      before all the folk, saying, "Eat; this is my bride-feast; for I purpose to go in to the Princess Dunya this
      night." said the Shaykh al-Islam, "It is not lawful for you to go in unto her till her days of widowhood be
      ended and you have drawn up thy contract of marriage with her." But he answered, "I know neither days of
      widowhood nor other period; so multiply not words on me." The Shaykh al-Islam was silent, fearing his mischief,
      and said to the troops, "Verily, this man is a Kafir, a Miscreant, and hath neither creed nor religious conduct."
      As soon as it was evenfall, he went in to her and found her robed in her richest raiment and decked with her
      goodliest adornments. When she saw him, she came to meet him, laughing and said, "A blessed night! But hadst thou
      slain my father and my husband, it had been more to my mind." And he said, "There is no help but I slay them."
      Then she made him sit down and began to jest with him and make show of love caressing him and smiling in his face
      so that his reason fled; but she cajoled him with her coaxing and cunning only that she might get possession of
      the ring and change his joy into calamity on the mother of his forehead: nor did she deal thus with him but after
      the rede of him who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>I attained by my wits * What no sword had obtained,<br />
        And return wi' the spoils * Whose sweet pluckings I gained.<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>When he saw her caress him and smile upon him, desire surged up in him and he besought her of carnal knowledge;
      but, when he approached her, she drew away from him and burst into tears, saying, "O my lord, seest you not the
      man looking at us? I conjure you by Allah, screen me from his eyes! How canst you know me what while he looketh
      on us?" When he heard this, he was angry and asked, "Where is the man?"; and answered she, "There he is, in the
      bezel of the ring! putting out his head and staring at us." He thought that the Jinni was looking at them and said
      laughing, "Fear not; this is the Slave of the Seal-ring, and he is subject to me." said she, "I am afraid of
      Ifrits; pull it off and throw it afar from me." So he plucked it off and laying it on the cushion, drew near to
      her, but she dealt him a kick, her foot striking him full in the stomach, and he fell over on his back senseless;
      whereupon she cried out to her attendants, who came to her in hase, and said to them, "Seize him!" So forty
      slavegirls laid hold on him, while she hurriedly snatched up the ring from the cushion and rubbed it; whereupon
      Abu al-Sa'adat presented himself, saying, "Adsum, at thy service O my mistress." Cried she, "Take up yonder
      Infidel and clap him in jail and shackle him heavily." So he took him and throwing him into the Prison of Wrath
      returned and reported, "I have laid him in limbo." said she, "Whither wentest you with my father and my
      husband?"; and said he, "I cast them down in the Desert Quarter." Then cried she, "I command you to fetch them
      to me forthwith." He replied, "I hear and I obey," and taking flight at once, stayed not till he reached the
      Desert Quarter, where he lighted down upon them and found them sitting weeping and complaining each to other.
      said he, "Fear not, for relief is come to you"; and he told them what the Wazir had done, adding, "Indeed I
      imprisoned him with my own hands in obedience to her, and she hath bidden me bear you back." And they rejoiced in
      his news. Then he took them both up and flew home with them; nor was it more than an hour before he brought them
      in to Princess Dunya, who rose and saluted sire and spouse. Then she made them sit down and brought them food and
      sweetmeats, and they passed the rest of the night with her. On the next day she clad them in rich clothing and
      said to the King, "O my papa, sit you upon thy throne and be King as before and make my husband thy Wazir of the
      Right and tell thy troops that which hath happened. Then send for the Minister out of prison and do him die, and
      after burn him, for that he is a Miscreant, and would have gone in unto me in the way of lewdness, without the
      rites of wedlock and he hath testified against himself that he is an Infidel and believed in no religion. And do
      tenderly by thy son-in-law, whom you makest thy Wazir of the Right." He replied, "Hearing and obeying, O my
      daughter. But do you give me the ring or give it to thy husband." said she, "It behoved not that either you or
      he have the ring. I will keep the ring myself, and belike I shall be more careful of it than you. Whatso ye wish
      seek it of me and I will demand it for you of the Slave of the Seal-ring. So fear no harm so long as I live and
      after my death, do what ye twain will with the ring." said the King, "This is the right rede, O my daughter," and
      taking his son-in-law went forth to the Divan. Now the troops had passed the night in sore chagrin for Princess
      Dunya and that which the Wazir had done with her, in going in to her after the way of lewdness, without
      marriage-rites, and for his ill-usage of the King and Ma'aruf, and they feared lest the law of Al-Islam be
      dishonoured, because it was manifest to them that he was a Kafir. So they assembled in the Divan and fell to
      reproaching the Shaykh al-Islam, saying, "Why didst you not forbid him from going in to the Princess in the way
      of lewdness?" Said he, "O folk, the man is a Miscreant and hath gotten possession of the ring and I and you may
      not prevail against him. But Almighty Allah will requite him his deed, and be ye silent, lest he slay you." And as
      the host was thus engaged in talk, behold the King and Ma'aruf entered the Divan.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
      of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Thousandth Night,</p>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the troops sorely chagrined sat in the Divan
      talking over the ill-deeds done by the Wazir to their Sovran, his son-in-law and his daughter, behold, the King
      and Ma'aruf entered. Then the King bade decorate the city and sent to fetch the Wazir from the place of duresse.
      So they brought him, and as he passed by the troops, they cursed him and abused him and menaced him, till he came
      to the King, who commanded to do him dead by the vilest of deaths. Accordingly, they slew him and after burned his
      body, and he went to Hell after the foulest of plights; and right well said one of him:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>The Compassionate show no ruth to the tomb where his bones shall lie * And Munkar and eke Nakír ne'er cease to
        abide thereby!</p>
    </div>
    <p>The King made Ma'aruf his Wazir of the Right and the times were pleasant to them and their joys were untroubled.
      They abode thus five years till, in the sixth year, the King died and Princess Dunya made Ma'aruf Sultan in her
      father's stead, but she gave him not the seal-ring. During this time she had conceived by him and borne him a boy
      of passing loveliness, excelling in beauty and perfection, who ceased not to be reared in the laps of nurses till
      he reached the age of five, when his mother fell sick of a deadly sickness and calling her husband to her, said to
      him, "I am ill." said he, "Allah preserve you, O dearling of my heart!" But said she, "Haply I shall die and
      you needest not that I commend to thy care thy son: wherefore I charge you but be careful of the ring, for thine
      own sake and for the sake of this thy boy." And he answered, "No harm shall befal him whom Allah preserveth!" Then
      she pulled off the ring and gave it to him, and on the morrow she was admitted to the mercy of Allah the Most
      High, while Ma'aruf abode in possession of the kingship and applied himself to the business of governing. Now it
      chanced that one day, as he shook the handkerchief and the troops withdrew to their places that he betook himself
      to the sitting-chamber, where he sat till the day departed and the night advanced with murks bedight. Then came in
      to him his cup-companions of the notables according to their custom, and sat with him by way of solace and
      diversion, till midnight, when they craved permission to withdraw. He gave them leave and they retired to their
      houses; after which there came in to him a slave-girl affected to the service of his bed, who spread him the
      mattress and doffing his apparel, clad him in his sleeping-gown. Then he lay down and she kneaded his feet, till
      sleep overpowered him; whereupon she withdrew to her own chamber and slept. But suddenly he felt something beside
      him in the bed and awaking started up in alarm and cried, "I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned!" Then
      he opened his eyes and seeing by his side a woman foul of favour, said to her, "Who art thou?" Said she, "Fear
      not, I am thy wife Fatimah al-Urrah." Whereupon he looked in her face and knew her by her loathly form and the
      length of her dog-teeth: so he asked her, "Whence camest you in to me and who brought you to this country?" "In
      what country art you at this present?" "In the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khatan. But thou, when didst you leave
      Cairo?" "But now." "How can that be?" "Know," said she, "that, when I fell out with you and Satan prompted me to
      do you a damage, I complained of you to the magistrates, who sought for you and the Kazis enquired of you, but
      found you not. When two days were past, repentance gat hold upon me and I knew that the fault was with me; but
      penitence availed me not, and I abode for some days weeping for thy loss, till what was in my hand failed and I
      was obliged to beg my bread. So I fell to begging of all, from the courted rich to the contemned poor, and since
      you leftest me, I have eaten of the bitterness of beggary and have been in the sorriest of conditions. Every
      night I sat beweeping our separation and that which I suffered, since thy departure, of humiliation and ignominy,
      of abjection and misery." And she went on to tell him what had befallen her, while he stared at her in amazement,
      till she said, "Yesterday, I went about begging all day but none gave me aught; and as often as I accosted any one
      and craved of him a crust of bread, he reviled me and gave me naught. When night came, I went to bed supperless,
      and hunger burned me and sore on me was that which I suffered: and I sat weeping when, behold, one appeared to me
      and said, O woman why weepest thou? Said I, erst I had a husband who used to provide for me and fulfil my wishes;
      but he is lost to me and I know not whither he went and have been in sore straits since he left me. Asked he, What
      is thy husband's name? and I answered, His name is Ma'aruf. said he, I ken him. Know that thy husband is now
      Sultan in a certain city, and if you wilt, I will carry you to him. Cried I, I am under thy protection: of thy
      bounty bring me to him! So he took me up and flew with me between heaven and earth, till he brought me to this
      pavilion and said to me:— Enter yonder chamber, and you shalt see thy husband asleep on the couch. Accordingly I
      entered and found you in this state of lordship. Indeed I had not thought you would forsake me, who am thy
      mate, and praised be Allah who hath united you with me!" said Ma'aruf, "Did I forsake you or you me? Thou
      complainedst of me from Kazi to Kazi and endedst by denouncing me to the High Court and bringing down on me Abú
      Tabak from the Citadel: so I fled in mine own despite." And he went on to tell her all that had befallen him and
      how he was become Sultan and had married the King's daughter and how his beloved Dunya had died, leaving him a son
      who was then seven years old. She rejoined, "That which happened was fore-ordained of Allah; but I repent me and I
      place myself under thy protection beseeching you not to abandon me, but suffer me eat bread, with you by way of
      an alms." And she ceased not to humble herself to him and to supplicate him till his heart relented towards her
      and he said, "Repent from mischief and abide with me, and naught shall betide you save what shall pleasure you:
      but, an you work any wickedness, I will slay you nor fear any one. And fancy not that you canst complain of me
      to the High Court and that Abu Tabak will come down on me from the Citadel; for I am become Sultan and the folk
      dread me: but I fear none save Allah Almighty, because I have a talismanic ring which when I rub, the Slave of the
      Signet appeared to me. His name is Abu al-Sa'adat, and whatsoever I demand of him he bringeth to me. So, an thou
      desire to return to thine own country, I will give you what shall suffice you all thy life long and will send
      you thither speedily; but, an you desire to abide with me, I will clear for you a palace and furnish it with
      the choicest of silks and appoint you twenty slave-girls to serve you and provide you with dainty dishes and
      sumptuous suits, and you shalt be a Queen and live in all delight till you die or I die. What sayest you of
      this?" "I wish to abide with you," she answered and kissed his hand and vowed repentance from frowardness.
      Accordingly he set apart a palace for her sole use and gave her slave-girls and eunuchs, and she became a Queen.
      The young Prince used to visit her as he visited his sire; but she hated him for that he was not her son; and when
      the boy saw that she looked on him with the eye of aversion and anger, he shunned her and took a dislike to her.
      As for Ma'aruf, he occupied himself with the love of fair handmaidens and bethought him not of his wife Fatimah
      the Dung, for that she was grown a grizzled old fright, foul-favoured to the sight, a bald-headed blight,
      loathlier than the snake speckled black and white; the more that she had beyond measure evil entreated him
      aforetime; and as said the adage, "Ill-usage the root of desire disparts and sows hate in the soil of hearts;"
      and God-gifted is he who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>Beware of losing hearts of men by thine injurious deed; * For<br />
             when Aversion takes his place none may dear Love restore:<br />
        Hearts, when affection flies from them, are likest unto glass *<br />
             Which broken, cannot whole be made,—'tis breached for<br />
             evermore.<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>And indeed Ma'aruf had not given her shelter by reason of any praiseworthy quality in her, but he dealt with her
      thus generously only of desire for the approval of Allah Almighty.— Here Dunyazad interrupted her sister
      Shahrazad, saying, "How winsome are these words of thine which win hold of the heart more forcibly than
      enchanters' eyne; and how beautiful are these wondrous books you has cited and the marvellous and singular tales
      you has recited!" said Shahrazad, "And where is all this compared with what I shall relate to you on the
      coming night, an I live and the King deign spare my days?" So when morning morrowed and the day brake in its sheen
      and shone, the King arose from his couch with breast broadened and in high expectation for the rest of the tale
      and saying, "By Allah, I will not slay her till I hear the last of her story;" repaired to his Durbár while the
      Wazir, as was his wont, presented himself at the Palace, shroud under arm. Shahriyar tarried abroad all that day,
      bidding and forbidding between man and man; after which he returned to his Harim and, according to his custom went
      in to his wife Shahrazad.</p>
    <p class="night-seperator">When it was the Thousand and First Night,</p>
    <p>Dunyazad said to her sister, "Do you finish for us the History of Ma'aruf!" She replied, "With love and goodly
      gree, an my lord deign permit me recount it." said the King, "I permit you; for that I am fain of hearing it."
      So she said:—It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ma'aruf would have naught to do with his wife by way of
      conjugal duty. Now when she saw that he held aloof from her bed and occupied himself with other women, she hated
      him and jealousy gat the mastery of her and Iblis prompted her to take the seal-ring from him and slay him and
      make herself Queen in his stead. So she went forth one night from her pavilion, intending for that in which was
      her husband King Ma'aruf; and it chanced by decree of the Decreer and His written destiny, that Ma'aruf lay that
      night with one of his concubines; a damsel endowed with beauty and loveliness, symmetry and a stature all grace.
      And it was his wont, of the excellence of his piety, that, when he was minded to have to lie with a woman, he
      would doff the enchanted seal-ring from his finger, in reverence to the Holy Names graven thereon, and lay it on
      the Pillow, nor would he don it again till he had purified himself by the Ghusl-ablution. Moreover, when he had
      lain with a woman, he was used to order her go forth from him before daybreak, of his fear for the seal-ring; and
      when he went to the Hammam he locked the door of the pavilion till his return, when he put on the ring, and after
      this, all were free to enter according to custom. His wife Fatimah the Dung knew of all this and went not forth
      from her place till she had certified herself of the case. So she sallied out, when the night was dark, purposing
      to go in to him, while he was drowned in sleep, and steal the ring, unseen of him. Now it chanced at this time
      that the King's son had gone out, without light, to the Chapel of Ease for an occasion, and sat down over the
      marble slab of the jakes in the dark, leaving the door open. Presently, he saw Fatimah come forth of her pavilion
      and make stealthily for that of his father and said in himself, "What aileth this witch to leave her lodging in
      the dead of the night and make for my father's pavilion? Needs must there be some reason for this:" so he went out
      after her and followed in her steps unseen of her. Now he had a short sword of watered steel, which he held so
      dear that he went not to his father's Divan, except he were girt therewith; and his father used to laugh at him
      and exclaim, "Mahallah! This is a mighty fine sword of thine, O my son! But you has not gone down with it to
      battle nor cut off a head therewith." Whereupon the boy would reply, "I will not fail to cut off with it some head
      which deserved cutting." And Ma'aruf would laugh at his words. Now when treading in her track, he drew the sword
      from its sheath and he followed her till she came to his father's pavilion and entered, while he stood and
      watched her from the door. He saw her searching about and heard her say to herself, "Where hath he laid the
      seal-ring?"; whereby he knew that she was looking for the ring and he waited till she found it and said, "Here it
      is." Then she picked it up and turned to go out; but he hid behind the door. As she came forth, she looked at the
      ring and turned it about in her grasp. But when she was about to rub it, he raised his hand with the sword and
      smote her on the neck; and she cried a single cry and fell down dead. With this Ma'aruf awoke and seeing his wife
      strown on the ground, with her blood flowing, and his son standing with the drawn sword in his hand, said to him,
      "What is this, O my son?" He replied, "O my father, how often has you said to me, you has a mighty fine sword;
      but you has not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head. And I have answered you, saying, I will not
      fail to cut off with it a head which deserved cutting. And now, behold, I have therewith cut off for you a head
      well worth the cutting!" And he told him what had passed. Ma'aruf sought for the seal-ring, but found it not; so
      he searched the dead woman's body till he saw her hand closed upon it; whereupon he took it from her grasp and
      said to the boy, "you art indeed my very son, without doubt or dispute; Allah ease you in this world and the
      next, even as you has eased me of this vile woman! Her attempt led only to her own destruction, and Allah-gifted
      is he who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>When forwards Allah's aid a man's intent, * His wish in every<br />
             case shall find consent:<br />
        But an that aid of Allah be refused, * His first attempt shall do<br />
             him damagement."<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>Then King Ma'aruf called aloud to some of his attendants, who came in hase, and he told them what his wife
      Fatimah the Dung had done and bade them to take her and lay her in a place till the morning. They did his bidding,
      and next day he gave her in charge to a number of eunuchs, who washed her and shrouded her and made her a tomb and
      buried her. Thus her coming from Cairo was but to her grave, and Allah-gifted is he who said:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>We trod the steps appointed for us: and he whose steps are<br />
             appointed must tread them.<br />
        He whose death is decreed to take place in our land shall not die<br />
             in any land but that.<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>And how excellent is the saying of the poet:—</p>
    <div class="eng-poetry">
      <p>I wot not, whenas to a land I fare, * Good luck pursuing, what my<br />
             lot shall be.<br />
        Whether the fortune I perforce pursue * Or the misfortune which<br />
             pursued me.<br /></p>
    </div>
    <p>After this, King Ma'aruf sent for the husbandman, whose guest he had been, when he was a fugitive, and made him
      his Wazir of the Right and his Chief Counsellor. Then, learning that he had a daughter of passing beauty and
      loveliness, of qualities nature-ennobled at birth and exalted of worth, he took her to wife; and in due time he
      married his son. So they abode awhile in all solace of life and its delight and their days were serene and their
      joys untroubled, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies, the Depopulator
      of populous places and the Orphaner of sons and daughters. And glory be to the Living who died not and in whose
      hand are the Keys of the Seen and the Unseen!"</p>
