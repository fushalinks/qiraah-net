    <div class="eng-title">Story of king Sharayar and his brother king Shahzaman</div>
    <div class="arabic-text">

        ( حكى) والله اعلم انه فيما مضى من قديم الزمان وسالف العصر والاوان ملك من ملوك ساسان بجزائر الهند والصين صاحب جند
        واعوان ولدان احدهما كبير والاخر صغير. وكانا فارسين بطلين وكان الكبير افرس من الصغير وقد ملك البلاد وحكم بالعدل
        بين العباد اسمه الملك شهريار. وكان اخوه الصغير شاه زمان . وكان ملك سمرقند العجم ولم يزل الامر مستقيما في بلادهما
        وكل واحد منهما في مملكته حاكم عادل في رعيته مدة عشرين سنة، ولم يزالا على هذه الحالة الى ان اشتاق الكيبر الى اخيه
        الصغير فامر وزيره ان يسافر اليه سافر حتى وصل ودخل على اخيه وبلغه السلام واعلمه ان اخاه مشتاق اليه وقصده ان يزوره
        فاجابه بالسمع والطاعة وتجهز للسفر واقام وزيره حاكما على بلاده وخرج طالبا اخيه فلما كان نصف الليل تذكر حاجة نسيها
        في قصره فرجع ودخل قصره فوجد زوجته راقدة في فراشه معانقة عبدا اسود من العبيد فلما رأى هذا اسودت الدنيا في وجهه
        وقال في نفسه اذا كان هذا الامر قد وقع وانا ما فارقت المدينة فكيف حال هذه العاهرة اذا غبت عند اخي مدة ثم انه سل
        سيفه وضرب الاثنين فقتلهما في الفراش ورجع من وقته وساعته وامر بالرحيل وسار الى ان وصل الى مدينة اخيه ففرح اخوه
        بقدومه ثم خرج اليه ولاقاه وسلم عليه ففرح به غاية الفرح وزين له المدينة وجلس معه يتحدث بانشراح فتذكر الملك شاه
        زمان ما كان من امر زوجته فحصل عنده غم زائد واصفر لونه وضعف جسمه فلما رآه اخوه على هذه الحالة ظن في نفسه ان ذلك
        بسبب مفارقته بلاده وملكه، فترك سبيله ولم يسأل عن ذلك ثم انه قال له في بعض الايام يا اخي ان في باطني جرحا. ولم
        يخبره بما رأى من زوجته، فقال اني اريد ان تسافر معي الى الصيد والقنص لعل صدرك ينشرح فأبى ذلك. فسافر اخوه وحده الى
        الصيد وكان في قصره شبابيك تطل على بستان اخيه فنظر واذا باب القصر قد فتح وخرج منه عشرون جارية وعشرون عبدا، وامرأة
        اخيه تمشي بينهم وهي في غاية الحسن والجمال حتى وصلوا الى فسيقة وخلعوا ثيابهم وجلسوا مع بعضهم . واذا بامرأة الملك
        قالت يا مسعود فجاءها عبد اسود فعانقها وعانقته وواقعها، وكذلك باقي العبيد فعلوا بالجواري، ولم يزالوا في بوس وعناق
        ونحو ذلك حتى ولى النهار فلما رأى ذلك اخو الملك قال والله ان بليتي اخف من هذه البلية وقد هان ما عنده من القهر
        والغم وقال هذا اعظم مما جرى لي، ولم يزل في اكل وشرب، وبعد هذا ا جاء اخوه من السفر فسلما على بعضهما، ونظر الملك
        شهريار الى اخيه الملك شاه زمان وقد رد لونه واحمر وجهه وصار يأكل بشهية بعدما كان قليل الاكل، فتعجب من ذلك وقال يا
        اخي كنت اراك مصفر اللون والوجه والان قد رد اليك لونك فاخبرني بحالك فقال له اما تغير لوني فاذكر ملك وعف عني عن
        اخبارك برد لوني، فقال له اخبرني اولا بتغير لونك وضعفك حتى اسمعه فقال له يا اخي انك لما ارسلت وزيرك الي يطلبني
        للحضور بين يديك جهزت حالي وقد برزت من مدينتي ثم اني تذكرت الخرزة التي اعطيتها لك في قصري فرجعت فوجدت زوجتي معها
        عبد اسود وهو نائم في فراشي فقتلتهما وجئت اليك وانا متفكر في هذا الامر فهذا سبب تغير لوني وضعفي. واما رد لوني
        فاعف عني من ان اذكره لك فلما سمع اخوه كلامه قال اقسمت عليك بالله ان تخبرني بسبب رد لونك فاعاد عليه جميع ما رأه
        فقال شهريار لاخيه شاه زمان مرادي ان انظر بعيني فقال له اخوه شاه زمان اجعل انك مسافر للصيد والقنص واختف عندي وانت
        شاهد ذلك وتحققه عيانا، فنادى الملك من ساعته بالسفر فخرجت العساكر والخيام الى ظاهرة المدينة وخرج الملك ثم انه جلس
        في الخيام وقال لغلمائه لا يدخل علي احد ثم انه تنكر وخرج متخفيا الى القصر الذي فيه اخوه وجلس في الشباك المطل على
        البستان ساعة من الزمان، واذا بالجواري وسيدتهم دخلوا مع العبيد وفعلوا كما قال له اخوه واستمروا كذلك الى العصر
        فلما رأى الملك شهريار ذلك الامر طار عقله من رأسه وقال لاخيه شاه زمان قم بنا نسافر الى حال سبيلنا وليس لنا حاجة
        بالملك حتى ننظر هل جرى لاحد مثلنا او لا، فيكون موتنا خير من حياتنا فاجابه لذلك ثم انهما خرجا من باب سري في القصر
        ولم يزالا مسافرين اياما ولياليا الى ان وصلا الى شجرة في وسط مرج عندها عين ماء بجانب البحر المالح فشربا من تلك
        العين وجلسا يستريحان فلما كان بعد ساعة مضت من النهار اذ هما بالبحر قد هاج وطلع منه عمود اسود صاعد الى السماء وهو
        قاصد تلك المرجة، قال فلما رأيا ذلك خافا وطلعا الى اعلى الشجرة وكانت عالية وصار ينظران ماذا يكون الخبر واذا بجني
        طويل القامة عريض الهامة واسع الصدر على رأسه صندوق فطلع الى البر وأتى نحو الشجرة التي هما فوقها وجلس تحتها وفتح
        الصندوق واخرج منه علبة ثم فتحها فخرجت منها صبية غراء بهية كأنها الشمس المضيئة كما قال الشاعر:

        اشرقت في الدجى فلاح النهار واستنارت بنورها الاسحار

        من سناها الشموس تشرق لما تتبدي وتنجلي الاقمار

        تسجد الكائنات بين يديها حين تبدو وتهتك الاستار

        واذا اومضت يروق حماها هطلت بالمدافع الامطار

        قال فلما نظر اليها الجني قال يا سيدة الحرائر التي قد اختطفتك ليلة عرسك اريد ان انام قليلا ثم ان الجني وضع رأسه
        على ركبتها ونام ، فرفعت رأسها الى اعلى الشجرة فرأت الملكين. فرفعت رأس الجني من فوق ركبتها ووضعتها على الارض
        ووقفت تحت الشجرة ، وقالت لهما بالاشارة انزلا ولا تخافا من هذا العفريت ، فقالا لها بالله عليك ان تسامحينا من هذا
        الامر فقالت لهما بالله عليكما ان تنزلا والا نبهت عليكما العفريت فيقتلكما، ونزلا اليها فقامت لهما وقالت ارصعا
        رصعا عنيفا والا انبه عليكما العفريت فقالت لهما مالي اراكما تتغامزان ان لم تتقدما وتفعلا نبهت عليكما العفريت فمن
        خوفهما من الجني فعلا ما امرتهما به فلما فرغا قالت لهما اقفا واخرجت لهما من جيبها كيسا واخرجت منه عقدا فيه
        خمسمائة وسبعون خاتما فقالت لهما اتدريان ما هذه فقالا لها لا ندري فقالت لهما اصحاب هذه الخواتم كلهم كانوا يفعلون
        بي على غفلة قرن هذا العفريت فأعطياني خاتميكما انتما الآخران فأعطياها من يديهما خاتمين فقالت لهما ان هذا العفريت
        قد اختطفني ليلة عرسي ثم انه وضعني في علبة وجعل العلبة داخل الصندوق ورمى على الصندوق سبعة اقفال وجعلني في قاع
        البحر العجاج المتلاطم بالامواج ويعلم ان المرأة منا اذا ارادت امرا لم يغلبها شيء.

        تعجبا غاية ´العجب وقالا لبعضهما اذا كان هذا عفريتا وجرى له اعظم مما جرى لنا فهذا شيء يسلينا ثم انصرفا من ساعتهما
        عنها ورجعا الى مدينة الملك شهريار ودخلا قصره ثم انه رمى عنق زوجته وكذلك اعناق الجواري والعبيد وصار المك شهريار
        كلما ياخذ بنتا بكرا يزيل بكارتها ويقتلها من ليلتها ولم يزل على ذلك مدة ثلاث سنوات فضجت الناس وهربت ببناتها ولم
        يبق في المدينة بنت تتحمل الوطء. ثم ان الملك امر الوزير بان يأتيه ببنت على جري عادته فخرج الوزير وفتش فلم يجد
        بنتا فتوجه الى منزله وهو غضبان مقهور خائف على نفسه من الملك وكان الوزير له بنتان ذا حسن وجمال وبهاء وقد واعتدال
        الكبيرة اسمها شهرزاد والصغيرة اسمها دنيازاد وكانت الكبيرة قد قرأت الكتب والتواريخ وسير الملوك المتقدمين واخبار
        الامم الماضين قيل انها جمعت الف كتاب من كتب التواريخ المتعلقة بالامم السالفة والشعراء فقالت لابيها مالي اراك
        متغيرا حاملا الهم والاحزان وقد قال بعضهم في المعنى شعرا :

        قل لمن يحمل هما ان حما لا يدوم

        مثل ما يفنى السرور هكذا تفنى الهموم

        فلما سمع الوزير من ابنته هذا الكلام حكى لها ما جرى له من الأول إلى الآخر مع الملك فقالت له: بالله يا أبت زوجني
        هذا الملك فإما أن أعيش وإما أن أكون فداء لبنات المسلمين وسبباً لخلاصهن من بين يديه، فقال لها: بالله عليك لا
        تخاطري بنفسك أبداً، فقالت له: لا بد من ذلك فقال: أخشى عليك أن يحصل لكن ما حصل الحمار والثور مع صاحب الزرع، فقالت
        له: وما الذي جرى لهما يا أبت؟

        To proceed:—The lives of former generations are a lesson to posterity; that a man may review the remarkable
        events2 which have happened to others, and be admonished; and may consider the history of people of preceding
        ages, and of all that hath befallen them, and be restrained. Extolled be the perfection of Him who hath thus
        ordained the history of former generations to be a lesson to those which follow. Such are the Tales of a
        Thousand and One Nights, with their romantic stories and their fables.
        Having taken the advice of the Wezeer on this subject, he immediately gave orders to prepare handsome presents,
        such as horses adorned with gold and costly jewels, and memlooks, and beautiful virgins, and expensive stuffs.10
        He then wrote a letter to his brother, expressive of his great desire to see him;11 and having sealed it, and
        given it to the Wezeer, together with the presents above mentioned, he ordered the minister to strain his
        nerves, and tuck up his skirts, and use all expedition in returning. The Wezeer answered, without delay, I hear
        and obey; and forthwith prepared for the journey: he packed his baggage, removed the burdens, and made ready all
        his provisions within three days; and on the fourth day, he took leave of the King Shahriyár, and went forth
        towards the deserts and wastes. He proceeded night and day; and each of the kings under the authority of King
        Shahriyár by whose residence he passed came forth to meet him,12 with costly presents, and gifts of gold and
        silver, and entertained him three days;13 after which, on the fourth day, he accompanied him one day's journey,
        and took leave of him. Thus he continued on his way until he drew near to the city of Samarḳand, when he sent
        forward a messenger to inform King Sháh-Zemán of3 his approach. The messenger entered the city, inquired the way
        to the palace, and, introducing himself to the King, kissed the ground before him,14 and acquainted him with the
        approach of his brother's Wezeer; upon which Sháh-Zemán ordered the chief officers of his court, and the great
        men of his kingdom, to go forth a day's journey to meet him; and they did so; and when they met him, they
        welcomed him, and walked by his stirrups until they returned to the city. The Wezeer then presented himself
        before the King Sháh-Zemán, greeted him with a prayer for the divine assistance in his favour, kissed the ground
        before him, and informed him of his brother's desire to see him; after which he handed to him the letter. The
        King took it, read it, and understood its contents;15 and answered by expressing his readiness to obey the
        commands of his brother. But, said he (addressing the Wezeer), I will not go until I have entertained thee three
        days. Accordingly, he lodged him in a palace befitting his rank, accommodated his troops in tents, and appointed
        them all things requisite in the way of food and drink: and so they remained three days. On the fourth day, he
        equipped himself for4 the journey, made ready his baggage, and collected together costly presents suitable to
        his brother's dignity.

        These preparations being completed, he sent forth his tents and camels and mules and servants and guards,
        appointed his Wezeer to be governor of the country during his absence, and set out towards his brother's
        dominions. At midnight,16 however, he remembered that he had left in his palace an article which he should have
        brought with him; and having returned to the palace to fetch it, he there beheld his wife sleeping in his bed,
        and attended by a male negro slave, who had fallen asleep by her side. On beholding this scene, the world became
        black before his eyes; and he said within himself, If this is the case when I have not departed from the city,
        what will be the conduct of this vile woman while I am sojourning with my brother? He then drew his sword, and
        slew them both in the bed: after which he immediately returned, gave orders for departure, and journeyed to his
        brother's capital.

        Shahriyár, rejoicing at the tidings of his approach, went forth to meet him, saluted him, and welcomed him with
        the utmost delight. He then ordered that the city should be decorated on the occasion,17 and sat down to
        entertain his brother with cheerful conversation: but the mind of King Sháh-Zemán was distracted by reflections
        upon the conduct of his wife; excessive grief took possession of him; and his countenance became sallow; and his
        frame, emaciated. His brother observed his altered condition, and, imagining that it was occasioned by his
        absence from his dominions, abstained from troubling him or5 asking respecting the cause, until after the lapse
        of some days, when at length he said to him, O my brother, I perceive that thy body is emaciated, and thy
        countenance is become sallow. He answered, O brother, I have an internal sore:—and he informed him not of the
        conduct of his wife which he had witnessed. Shahriyár then said, I wish that thou wouldest go out with me on a
        hunting excursion; perhaps thy mind might so be diverted:—but he declined; and Shahriyár went alone to the
        chase.18
        Now there were some windows in the King's palace commanding a view of his garden; and while his brother was
        looking out from one of these, a door of the palace was opened, and there came forth from it twenty females and
        twenty male black slaves; and the King's wife, who was distinguished by extraordinary beauty and elegance,19
        accompanied them to a fountain, where they all disrobed themselves, and sat down together. The King's wife then
        called out, O Mes'ood!20 and immediately a black slave came to her, and embraced her; she doing the like. So
        also did the other slaves and the women; and all of them continued revelling together until the close of the
        day. When Sháh-Zemán beheld this spectacle, he said within himself, By Allah! my affliction is lighter than
        this! His vexation and grief were alleviated, and he no longer abstained from sufficient food and drink.

        When his brother returned from his excursion, and they had6 saluted each other, and King Shahriyár observed his
        brother Sháh-Zemán, that his colour had returned, that his face had recovered the flush of health, and that he
        ate with appetite, after his late abstinence, he was surprised, and said, O my brother, when I saw thee last,
        thy countenance was sallow, and now thy colour hath returned to thee: acquaint me with thy state.—As to the
        change of my natural complexion, answered Sháh-Zemán, I will inform thee of its cause; but excuse my explaining
        to thee the return of my colour.—First, said Shahriyár, relate to me the cause of the change of thy proper
        complexion, and of thy weakness: let me hear it.—Know then, O my brother, he answered, that when thou sentest
        thy Wezeer to me to invite me to thy presence, I prepared myself for the journey, and when I had gone forth from
        the city, I remembered that I had left behind me the jewel that I have given thee; I therefore returned to my
        palace for it, and there I found my wife sleeping in my bed, and attended by a black male slave; and I killed
        them both, and came to thee: but my mind was occupied by reflections upon this affair, and this was the cause of
        the change of my complexion, and of my weakness: now, as to the return of my colour, excuse my informing thee of
        its cause.—But when his brother heard these words, he said, I conjure thee by Allah that thou acquaint me with
        the cause of the return of thy colour:—so he repeated to him all that he had seen. I would see this, said
        Shahriyár, with my own eye.—Then, said Sháh-Zemán, give out that thou art going again to the chase, and conceal
        thyself here with me, and thou shalt witness this conduct, and obtain ocular proof of it.
        Shahriyár, upon this, immediately announced that it was his intention to make another excursion. The troops went
        out of the city7 with the tents, and the King followed them; and after he had reposed awhile in the camp, he
        said to his servants, Let no one come in to me:—and he disguised himself, and returned to his brother in the
        palace, and sat in one of the windows overlooking the garden; and when he had been there a short time, the women
        and their mistress entered the garden with the black slaves, and did as his brother had described, continuing so
        until the hour of the afternoon-prayer.
        When King Shahriyár beheld this occurrence, reason fled from his head, and he said to his brother Sháh-Zemán,
        Arise, and let us travel whither we please, and renounce the regal state, until we see whether such a calamity
        as this have befallen any other person like unto us; and if not, our death will be preferable to our life. His
        brother agreed to his proposal, and they went out from a private door of the palace, and journeyed continually,
        days and nights, until they arrived at a tree in the midst of a meadow, by a spring of water, on the shore of
        the sea. They drank of this spring, and sat down to rest; and when the day had a little advanced, the sea became
        troubled8 before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending towards the sky, and approaching the
        meadow. Struck with fear at the sight, they climbed up into the tree, which was lofty; and thence they gazed to
        see what this might be: and behold, it was a Jinnee,21 of gigantic stature, broad-fronted and bulky, bearing on
        his head a chest.22 He landed, and came to the tree into which the two Kings had climbed, and, having seated
        himself beneath it, opened the chest, and took out of it another box, which he also opened; and there came forth
        from it a young woman, fair and beautiful, like the shining sun. When the Jinnee cast his eyes upon her, he
        said, O lady of noble race, whom I carried off on thy wedding-night, I have a desire to sleep a little:—and he
        placed his head upon her knee, and slept. The damsel then9 raised her head towards the tree, and saw there the
        two Kings; upon which she removed the head of the Jinnee from her knee, and, having placed it on the ground,
        stood under the tree, and made signs to the two Kings, as though she would say, Come down, and fear not this
        'Efreet.23 They answered her, We conjure thee by Allah that thou excuse us in this matter. But she said, I
        conjure you by the same that ye come down; and if ye do not, I will rouse this 'Efreet, and he shall put you to
        a cruel death. So, being afraid, they came down to her; and, after they had remained with her as long as she
        required, she took from her pocket a purse, and drew out from this a string, upon which were ninety-eight
        seal-rings;24 and she said to them, Know ye what are these? They answered, We know not.—The owners of these
        rings, said she, have, all of them, been admitted to converse with me, like as ye have, unknown to this foolish
        'Efreet; therefore, give me your two rings,25 ye brothers. So they gave her their two rings from their fingers;
        and she then said to them, This 'Efreet carried me off on my wedding-night, and put me in the box, and placed
        the box in the chest, and affixed to the chest seven locks, and deposited me, thus imprisoned, in the bottom of
        the roaring sea, beneath the dashing waves; not knowing that, when one of our sex desires to accomplish any
        object, nothing can prevent her. In accordance with this, says one of the poets:—

        Never trust in women; nor rely upon their vows;
        For their pleasure and displeasure depend upon their passions.
        They offer a false affection; for perfidy lurks within their clothing.
        By the tale of Yoosuf26 be admonished, and guard against their stratagems.
        Dost thou not consider that Iblees ejected Adam by means of woman?
        And another poet says:—

        Abstain from censure; for it will strengthen the censured, and increase desire into violent passion.
        If I suffer such passion, my case is but the same as that of many a man before me:
        For greatly indeed to be wondered at is he who hath kept himself safe from women's artifice.27

        When the two Kings heard these words from her lips, they were struck with the utmost astonishment, and said, one
        to the other, If this is an 'Efreet, and a greater calamity hath happened unto him than that which hath befallen
        us, this is a circumstance that should console us:—and immediately they departed, and returned to the city.

        As soon as they had entered the palace, Shahriyár caused his wife to be beheaded, and in like manner the women
        and black slaves;10 and thenceforth he made it his regular custom, every time that he took a virgin to his bed,
        to kill her at the expiration of the night. Thus he continued to do during a period of three years; and the
        people raised an outcry against him, and fled with their daughters, and there remained not a virgin in the city
        of a sufficient age for marriage.28 Such was the case when the King ordered the Wezeer to bring him a virgin
        according to his custom; and the Wezeer went forth and searched, and found none; and he went back to his house
        enraged and vexed, fearing what the King might do to him.

        Now the Wezeer had two daughters; the elder of whom was named Shahrazád; and the younger, Dunyázád. The former
        had read various books of histories, and the lives of preceding kings, and stories of past generations: it is
        asserted that she had collected together a thousand books of histories, relating to preceding generations and
        kings, and works of the poets: and she said to her father on this occasion, Why do I see thee thus changed, and
        oppressed with solicitude and sorrows? It has been said by one of the poets:—

        Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety, that anxiety will not last:
        As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.
        When the Wezeer heard these words from his daughter, he related to her all that had happened to him with regard
        to the King: upon which she said, By Allah, O my father, give me in marriage to this King: either I shall die,
        and be a ransom for one of the daughters of the Muslims, or I shall live, and be the cause of their deliverance
        from him.29—I conjure thee by Allah, exclaimed he, that thou expose not thyself to such peril:—but she said, It
        must be so. Then, said he, I fear for thee that the same will befall thee that happened in the case of the ass
        and the bull and the husbandman.—And what, she asked, was that, O my father.
