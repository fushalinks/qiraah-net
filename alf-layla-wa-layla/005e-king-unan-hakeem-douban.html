    <h3><a id="chap09" />The Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban.</h3>
    <p>Know, O thou Ifrit, that in days of yore and in ages long gone before, a King called Yunan reigned over the city
      of Fars of the land of the Roum. He was a powerful ruler and a wealthy, who had armies and guards and allies of
      all nations of men; but his body was afflicted with a leprosy which leaches and men of science failed to heal. He
      drank potions and he swallowed pow ders and he used unguents, but naught did him good and none among the host of
      physicians availed to procure him a cure. At last there came to his city a mighty healer of men and one well
      stricken in years, the sage Duban highs. This man was a reader of books, Greek, Persian, Roman, Arabian, and
      Syrian; and he was skilled in astronomy and in leechcraft, the theorick as well as the practick; he was
      experienced in all that healeth and that hurteth the body; conversant with the virtues of every plant, grass and
      herb, and their benefit and bane; and he understood philosophy and had compassed the whole range of medical
      science and other branches of the knowledge tree. Now this physician passed but few days in the city, ere he heard
      of the King's malady and all his bodily sufferings through the leprosy with which Allah had smitten him; and how
      all the doctors and wise men had failed to heal him. Upon this he sat up through the night in deep thought and,
      when broke the dawn and appeared the morn and light was again born, and the Sun greeted the Good whose beauties
      the world adorn, he donned his handsomest dress and going in to King Yunan, he kissed the ground before him: then
      he prayed for the endurance of his honour and prosperity in fairest language and made himself known saying, "O
      King, tidings have reached I me of what befel thee through that which is in thy person; and how the host of
      physicians have proved themselves unavailing to abate it; and lo! I can cure thee, O King; and yet will I not make
      thee drink of draught or anoint thee with ointment." Now when King Yunan heard his words he said in huge surprise,
      "How wilt thou do this? By Allah, if thou make me whole I will enrich thee even to thy son's son and I will give
      thee sumptuous gifts; and whatso thou wishest shall be thine and thou shalt be to me a cup companion and a
      friend." The King then robed him with a dress of honour and entreated him graciously and asked him, "Canst thou
      indeed cure me of this complaint without drug and unguent?" and he answered, "Yes! I will heal I thee without the
      pains and penalties of medicine." The King marvelled with exceeding marvel and said, "O physician, when shall be
      this whereof thou speakest, and in how many days shall it take place? Haste thee, O my son!" He replied,"I hear
      and I obey; the cure shall begin tomorrow." So saying he went forth from the presence, and hired himself a house
      in the city for the better storage of his books and scrolls, his medicines and his aromatic roots. Then he set to
      work at choosing the fittest drugs and simples and he fashioned a bat hollow within, and furnished with a handle
      without, for which he made a ball; the two being prepared with consummate art. On the next day when both were
      ready for use and wanted nothing more, he went up to the King; and, kissing the ground between his hands bade him
      ride forth on the parade ground there to play at pall and mall. He was accompanied by his suite, Emirs and
      Chamberlains, Wazirs and Lords of the realm and, ere he was seated, the sage Duban came up to him, and handing him
      the bat said, "Take this mall and grip it as I do; so! and now push for the plain and leaning well over thy horse
      drive the ball with all thy might until thy palm be moist and thy body perspire: then the medicine will penetrate
      through thy palm and will permeate thy person. When thou hast done with playing and thou feelest the effects of
      the medicine, return to thy palace, and make the Ghusl ablation in the Hammam bath, and lay thee down to sleep; so
      shalt thou be come whole; and now peace be with thee!" Thereupon King Yunan took the bat from the Sage and grasped
      it firmly; then, mounting steed, he drove the ball before him and gallopped after it till he reached it, when he
      struck it with all his might, his palm gripping the bat handle the while; and he ceased not malling the ball till
      his hand waxed moist and his skin, perspiring, imbibed the medicine from the wood. Then the sage Duban knew that
      the drugs had penetrated his person and bade him return to the palace and enter the Hammam without stay or delay;
      so King Yunan forthright returned and ordered them to clear for him the bath. They did so, the carpet spreaders
      making all haste, and the slaves all hurry and got ready a change of raiment for the King. He entered the bath and
      made the total ablution long and thoroughly; then donned his clothes within the Hammam and rode therefrom to his
      palace where he lay him down and slept. Such was the case with King Yunan, but as regards the sage Duban, he
      returned home and slept as usual and when morning dawned he repaired to the palace and craved audience. The King
      ordered him to be admitted; then, having kissed the ground between his hands, in allusion to the King he recited
      these couplets with solemn intonation:—</p>
    <p>Happy is Eloquence when thou art named her sire * But mourns<br />
           she whenas other man the title claimed.<br />
      O Lord of fairest presence, whose illuming rays * Clear off the<br />
           fogs of doubt aye veiling deeds high famed,<br />
      Ne'er cease thy face to shine like Dawn and rise of Morn * And<br />
           never show Time's face with heat of ire inflamed!<br />
      Thy grace hath favoured us with gifts that worked such wise * As<br />
           rain clouds raining on the hills by words enframed:<br />
      Freely thou lavishedst thy wealth to rise on high * Till won from<br />
           Time the heights whereat thy grandeur aimed.<br /></p>
    <p>Now when the Sage ceased reciting, the King rose quickly to his feet and fell on his neck; then, seating him by
      his side he bade dress him in a sumptuous dress; for it had so happened that when the King left the Hammam he
      looked on his body and saw no trace of leprosy: the skin was all clean as virgin silver. He joyed thereat with
      exceeding joy, his breast broadened with delight and he felt thoroughly happy. Presently, when it was full day he
      entered his audience hall and sat upon the throne of his kingship whereupon his Chamberlains and Grandees flocked
      to the presence and with them the Sage Duban. Seeing the leach the King rose to him in honour and seated him by
      his side; then the food trays furnished with the daintiest viands were brought and the physician ate with the
      King, nor did he cease companying him all that day. Moreover, at nightfall he gave the physician Duban two
      thousand gold pieces, besides the usual dress of honour and other gifts galore, and sent him home on his own
      steed. After the Sage had fared forth King Yunan again expressed his amazement at the leach's art, saying, "This
      man medicined my body from without nor anointed me with aught of ointments: by Allah, surely this is none other
      than consummate skill! I am bound to honour such a man with re wards and distinction, and take him to my companion
      and my friend during the remainder of my days." So King Yunan passed the night in joy and gladness for that his
      body had been made whole and had thrown off so pernicious a malady. On the morrow the King went forth from his
      Serraglio and sat upon his throne, and the Lords of Estate stood about him, and the Emirs and Wazirs sat as was
      their wont on his right hand and on his left. Then he asked for the Sage Duban, who came in and kissed the ground
      before him, when the King rose to greet him and, seating him by his side, ate with him and wished him long life.
      Moreover he robed him and gave him gifts, and ceased not con versing with him until night approached. Then the
      King ordered him, by way of salary, five dresses of honour and a thousand dinars. The physician returned to his
      own house full of gratitude to the King. Now when next morning dawned the King repaired to his audience hall, and
      his Lords and Nobles surrounded him and his Chamberlains and his Ministers, as the white en closeth the black of
      the eye. Now the King had a Wazir among his Wazirs, unsightly to look upon, an ill omened spectacle; sor did,
      ungenerous, full of envy and evil will. When this Minister saw the King place the physician near him and give him
      all these gifts, he jaloused him and planned to do him a harm, as in the saying on such subject, "Envy lurks in
      every body;" and the say ing, "Oppression hideth in every heart: power revealeth it and weakness concealeth it."
      Then the Minister came before the King and, kissing the ground between his hands, said, "O King of the age and of
      all time, thou in whose benefits I have grown to manhood, I have weighty advice to offer thee, and if I withhold
      it I were a son of adultery and no true born man; wherefore an thou order me to disclose it I will so do
      forthwith." Quoth the King (and he was troubled at the words of the Minister), "And what is this counsel of
      thine?" Quoth he, "O glorious monarch, the wise of old have said:—Whoso regardeth not the end, hath not Fortune to
      friend; and indeed I have lately seen the King on far other than the right way; for he lavisheth largesse on his
      enemy, on one whose object is the decline and fall of his king ship: to this man he hath shown favour, honouring
      him with over honour and making of him an intimate. Wherefore I fear for the King's life." The King, who was much
      troubled and changed colour, asked, "Whom cost thou suspect and anent whom doest thou hint?" and the Minister
      answered, "O King, an thou be asleep, wake up! I point to the physician Duban." Rejoined the King, "Fie upon thee!
      This is a true friend who is favoured by me above all men, because he cured me with some thing which I held in my
      hand, and he healed my leprosy which had baffled all physicians; indeed he is one whose like may not be found in
      these days—no, not in the whole world from furthest east to utmost west! And it is of such a man thou sayest such
      hard sayings. Now from this day forward I allot him a settled solde and allowances, every month a thousand gold
      pieces; and, were I to share with him my realm 'twere but a little matter. Perforce I must suspect that thou
      speakest on this wise from mere envy and jealousy as they relate of the King Sindibad."—And Shahrazad perceived
      the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth Dunyazad, "O my sister, how pleasant is thy tale,
      and how tasteful, how sweet, and how grateful!" She replied, "And where is this compared with what I could tell
      thee on the coming night if the King deign spare my life?" Then said the King in himself, "By Allah, I will not
      slay her until I hear the rest of her tale, for truly it is wondrous." So they rested that night in mutual embrace
      until the dawn. Then the King went forth to his Hall of Rule, and the Wazir and the troops came in, and the
      audience chamber was thronged and the King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade and forbade
      during the rest of that day till the Court broke up, and King Shahryar returned to his palace.</p>
    <p class="center">When It Was The Fifth Night,</p>
    <p>Her sister said, "Do you finish for us thy story if thou be not sleepy," and she resumed:—It hath reached me, O
      auspicious King and mighty Monarch, that King Yunan said to his Minister, "O Wazir, thou art one whom the evil
      spirit of envy hath possessed because of this physician, and thou plottest for my putting him to death, after
      which I should repent me full sorely, even as repented King Sindibad for killing his falcon." Quoth the Wazir,
      Pardon me, O King of the age, how was that?" So the King began the story of</p>
  </div>

  <a id="chap10" />King Sindibad and his Falcon.</h3>
  <p>It is said (but Allah is All knowing!) that there was a King of the Kings of Fars, who was fond of pleasuring and
    diversion, especially coursing end hunting. He had reared a falcon which he carried all night on his fist, and
    whenever he went a chasing he took with him this bird; and he bade make for her a golden cuplet hung around her neck
    to give her drink therefrom. One day as the King was sitting quietly in his palace, behold, the high falcaner of the
    household suddenly addressed him, "O King of the age, this is indeed a day fit for birding." The King gave orders
    accordingly and set out taking the hawk on fist; and they fared merrily forwards till they made a Wady where they
    planted a circle of nets for the chase; when lo! a gazelle came within the toils and the King cried, "Whoso alloweth
    yon gazelle to spring over his head and loseth her, that man will I surely slay." They narrowed the nets about the
    gazelle when she drew near the King's station; and, planting herself on her hind quarter, crossed her forehand over
    her breast, as if about to kiss the earth before the King. He bowed his brow low in acknowledgment to the beast;
    when she bounded high over his head and took the way of the waste. Thereupon the King turned towards his troops and
    seeing them winking and pointing at him, he asked, "O Wazir, what are my men saying?" and the Minister answered,
    "They say thou didst proclaim that whoso alloweth the gazelle to spring over his head, that man shall be put to
    death." Quoth the King, "Now, by the life of my head! I will follow her up till I bring her back." So he set off
    gallopping on the gazelle's trail and gave not over tracking till he reached the foot hills of a mountain chain
    where the quarry made for a cave. Then the King cast off at it the falcon which presently caught it up and, swooping
    down, drove her talons into its eyes, bewildering and blinding it; and the King drew his mace and struck a blow
    which rolled the game over. He then dismounted; and, after cutting the antelope's throat and flaying the body, hung
    it to the pommel of his saddle. Now the time was that of the siesta and the wold was parched and dry, nor was any
    water to be found anywhere; and the King thirsted and his horse also; so he went about searching till he saw a tree
    dropping water, as it were melted butter, from its boughs. Thereupon the King who wore gauntlets of skin to guard
    him against poisons took the cup from the hawk's neck, and filling it with the water set it before the bird, and lo!
    the falcon struck it with her pounces and upset the liquid. The King filled it a second time with the dripping
    drops, thinking his hawk was thirsty; but the bird again struck at the cup with her talons and overturned it. Then
    the King waxed wroth with the hawk and filling the cup a third time offered it to his horse: but the hawk upset it
    with a flirt of wings. Quoth the King, "Allah confound thee, thou unluckiest of flying things! thou keepest me from
    drinking, and thou deprivest thyself also, and the horse." So he struck the falcon with his sword and cut off her
    wing; but the bird raised her head and said by signs, "Look at that which hangeth on the tree!" The King lifted up
    his eyes accordingly and caught sight of a brood of vipers, whose poison drops he mistook for water; thereupon he
    repented him of having struck off his falcon's wing, and mounting horse, fared on with the dead gazelle, till he
    arrived at the camp, his starting place. He threw the quarry to the cook saying, Take and broil it," and sat down on
    his chair, the falcon being still on his fist when suddenly the bird gasped and died; whereupon the King cried out
    in sorrow and remorse for having slain that falcon which had saved his life. Now this is what occurred in the case
    of King Sindibad; and I am assured that were I to do as thou desirest I should repent even as the man who killed his
    parrot." Quoth the Wazir, "And how was that?" And the King began to tell</p>

    <h3><a id="chap11" />The Tale of the Husband and the Parrot.</h3>
    <p>A certain man and a merchant to boot had married a fair wife, a woman of perfect beauty and grace, symmetry and
      loveliness, of whom he was mad-jealous, and who contrived successfully to keep him from travel. At last an
      occasion compelling him to leave her, he went to the bird market and bought him for one hundred gold pieces a she
      parrot which he set in his house to act as duenna, expecting her to acquaint him on his return with what had
      passed during the whole time of his absence; for the bird was kenning and cunning and never forgot what she had
      seen and heard. Now his fair wife had fallen in love with a young Turk, who used to visit her, and she feasted him
      by day and lay with him by night. When the man had made his journey and won his wish he came home; and, at once
      causing the Parrot be brought to him, questioned her concerning the conduct of his consort whilst he was in
      foreign parts. Quoth she, "Thy wife hath a man friend who passed every night with her during thine absence."
      Thereupon the husband went to his wife in a violent rage and bashed her with a bashing severe enough to satisfy
      any body. The woman, suspecting that one of the slave girls had been tattling to the master, called them together
      and questioned them upon their oaths, when all swore that they had kept the secret, but that the Parrot had not,
      adding, "And we heard her with our own ears." Upon this the woman bade one of the girls to set a hand mill under
      the cage and grind therewith and a second to sprinkle water through the cage roof and a third to run about, right
      and left, dashing a mirror of bright steel through the livelong night. Next morning when the husband returned home
      after being entertained by one of his friends, he bade bring the Parrot before him and asked what had taken place
      whilst he was away. "Pardon me, O my master," quoth the bird, "I could neither hear nor see aught by reason of the
      exceeding murk and the thunder and lightning which lasted throughout the night." As it happened to be the summer
      tide the master was astounded and cried, "But we are now in mid Tammuz, and this is not the time for rains and
      storms." "Ay, by Allah," rejoined the bird, "I saw with these eyes what my tongue hath told thee." Upon this the
      man, not knowing the case nor smoking the plot, waxed exceeding wroth; and, holding that his wife had been
      wrongously accused, put forth his hand and pulling the Parrot from her cage dashed her upon the ground with such
      force that he killed her on the spot. Some days after wards one of his slave girls confessed to him the whole
      truth, yet would he not believe it till he saw the young Turk, his wife's lover, coming out of her chamber, when
      he bared his blade and slew him by a blow on the back of the neck; and he did the same by the adulteress; and thus
      the twain, laden with mortal sin, went straightways to Eternal Fire. Then the merchant knew that the Parrot had
      told him the truth anent all she had seen and he mourned grievously for her loss, when mourning availed him not.
      The Minister, hearing the words of King Yu nan, rejoined, 'O Monarch, high in dignity, and what harm have I done
      him, or what evil have I seen from him that I should compass his death? I would not do this thing, save to serve
      thee, and soon shalt thou sight that it is right; and if thou accept my advice thou shalt be saved, otherwise thou
      shalt be destroyed even as a certain Wazir who acted treacherously by the young Prince." Asked the King, "How was
      that?" and the Minister thus began</p>

  <div class="chapter" id="pgepubid00016">
    <h3><a id="chap12" />The Tale of the Prince and the Ogress.</h3>
    <p>A certain King, who had a son over much given to hunting and coursing, ordered one of his Wazirs to be in
      attendance upon him whithersoever he might wend. One day the youth set out for the chase accompanied by his
      father's Minister; and, as they jogged on together, a big wild beast came in sight. Cried the Wazir to the King's
      son, "Up and at yon noble quarry!" So the Prince followed it until he was lost to every eye and the chase got away
      from him in the waste; whereby he was confused and he knew not which way to turn, when lo! a damsel appeared ahead
      and she was in tears. The King's son asked, "Who art thou?" and she answered, "I am daughter to a King among the
      Kings of Hind, and I was travelling with a caravan in the desert when drowsiness overcame me, and I fell from my
      beast unwittingly whereby I am cut off from my people and sore bewildered." The Prince, hearing these words,
      pitied her case and, mounting her on his horse's crupper, travelled until he passed by an old ruin , when the
      damsel said to him, "O my master, I wish to obey a call of nature": he therefore set her down at the ruin where
      she delayed so long that the King's son thought that she was only wasting time; so he followed her without her
      knowledge and behold, she was a Ghulah, a wicked Ogress, who was saying to her brood, "O my children, this day I
      bring you a fine fat youth, for dinner;" whereto they answered, "Bring him quick to us, O our mother, that we may
      browse upon him our bellies full." The Prince hearing their talk, made sure of death and his side muscles quivered
      in fear for his life, so he turned away and was about to fly. The Ghulah came out and seeing him in sore affright
      (for he was trembling in every limb? cried, "Wherefore art thou afraid?" and he replied, "I have hit upon an enemy
      whom I greatly fear." Asked the Ghulah, "Diddest thou not say: - I am a King's son?" and he answered, "Even so."
      Then quoth she, "Why cost not give shine enemy something of money and so satisfy him?" Quoth he, "He will not be
      satisfied with my purse but only with my life, and I mortally fear him and am a man under oppression." She
      replied, "If thou be so distressed, as thou deemest, ask aid against him from Allah, who will surely protect thee
      from his ill doing and from the evil whereof thou art afraid." Then the Prince raised his eyes heavenwards and
      cried, "O Thou who answerest the necessitous when he calleth upon Thee and dispellest his distress; O my God !
      grant me victory over my foe and turn him from me, for Thou over all things art Almighty." The Ghulah, hearing his
      prayer, turned away from him, and the Prince returned to his father, and told him the tale of the Wazir; whereupon
      the King summoned the Minister to his presence and then and there slew him. Thou likewise, O King, if thou
      continue to trust this leach, shalt be made to die the worst of deaths. He verily thou madest much of and whom
      thou entreatedest as an intimate, will work thy destruction. Seest thou not how he healed the disease from outside
      thy body by something grasped in thy hand? Be not assured that he will not destroy thee by something held in like
      manner! Replied King Yunan, "Thou hast spoken sooth, O Wazir, it may well be as thou hintest O my well advising
      Minister; and belike this Sage hath come as a spy searching to put me to death; for assuredly if he cured me by a
      something held in my hand, he can kill me by a something given me to smell." Then asked King Yunan, "O Minister,
      what must be done with him?" and the Wazir answered, "Send after him this very instant and summon him to thy
      presence; and when he shall come strike him across the neck; and thus shalt thou rid thyself of him and his
      wickedness, and deceive him ere he can I deceive thee." 'Thou hast again spoken sooth, O Wazir," said the King and
      sent one to call the Sage who came in joyful mood for he knew not what had appointed for him the Compassionate; as
      a certain poet saith by way of illustration:—</p>
    <p>O Thou who fearest Fate, confiding fare * Trust all to Him who<br />
           built the world and wait:<br />
      What Fate saith "Be" perforce must be, my lord! * And safe art<br />
           thou from th undecreed of Fate.<br /></p>
    <p>As Duban the physician entered he addressed the King in these lines:—</p>
    <p>An fail I of my thanks to thee nor thank thee day by day * For<br />
           whom com posed I prose and verse, for whom my say and lay?<br />
      Thou lavishedst thy generous gifts ere they were craved by me *<br />
           Thou lavishedst thy boons unsought sans pretext or delay:<br />
      How shall I stint my praise of thee, how shall I cease to laud *<br />
           The grace of thee in secresy and patentest display?<br />
      Nay; I will thank thy benefits, for aye thy favours lie * Light<br />
           on my thought and tongue, though heavy on my back they<br />
           weigh.<br /></p>
    <p>And he said further on the same theme:—</p>
    <p>Turn thee from grief nor care a jot! * Commit thy needs to Fate<br />
           and Lot!<br />
      Enjoy the Present passing well * And let the Past be clean forgot<br />
      For whatso haply seemeth worse * Shall work thy weal as Allah<br />
           wot<br />
      Allah shall do whate'er He wills * And in His will oppose Him<br />
           not.<br /></p>
    <p>And further still.—</p>
    <p>To th' All wise Subtle One trust worldly things * Rest thee from<br />
           all whereto the worldling clings:<br />
      Learn wisely well naught cometh by thy will * But e'en as willeth<br />
           Allah, King of Kings.<br /></p>
    <p>And lastly.—</p>
    <p>Gladsome and gay forget thine every grief * Full often grief the<br />
           wisest hearts outwore:<br />
      Thought is but folly in the feeble slave * Shun it and so be<br />
           saved evermore.<br /></p>
    <p>Said the King for sole return, "Knowest thou why I have summoned thee?" and the Sage replied, "Allah Most Highest
      alone kenneth hidden things!" But the King rejoined, "I summoned thee only to take thy life and utterly to destroy
      thee." Duban the Wise wondered at this strange address with exceeding wonder and asked, "O King, and wherefore
      wouldest thou slay me, and what ill have I done thee?" and the King answered, "Men tell me thou art a spy sent
      hither with intent to slay me; and lo! I will kill thee ere I be killed by thee;" then he called to his Sworder,
      and said, "Strike me off the head of this traitor and deliver us from his evil practices." Quoth the Sage, "Spare
      me and Allah will spare thee; slay me not or Allah shall slay thee." And he repeated to him these very words, even
      as I to thee, O Ifrit, and yet thou wouldst not let me go, being bent upon my death. King Yunan only rejoined, "I
      shall not be safe without slaying thee; for, as thou healedst me by something held in hand, so am I not secure
      against thy killing me by something given me to smell or otherwise." Said the physician, "This then, O King, is
      thy requital and reward; thou returnest only evil for good." The King replied, "There is no help for it; die thou
      must and without delay." Now when the physician was certified that the King would slay him without waiting, he
      wept and regretted the good he had done to other than the good. As one hath said on this subject:—</p>
    <p>Of wit and wisdom is Maymunah bare * Whose sire in<br />
           wisdom all the wits outstrippeth:<br />
      Man may not tread on mud or dust or clay * Save by good sense,<br />
           else trippeth he and slippeth.<br /></p>
    <p>Hereupon the Sworder stepped forward and bound the Sage Duban's eyes and bared his blade, saying to the King, "By
      thy leave;" while the physician wept and cried, "Spare me and Allah will spare thee, and slay me not or Allah
      shall slay thee," and began repeating:—</p>
    <p>I was kind and 'scaped not, they were cruel and escaped; * And my<br />
           kindness only led me to Ruination Hall,<br />
      If I live I'll ne'er be kind; if I die, then all be damned * Who<br />
           follow me, and curses their kindliness befal.<br /></p>
    <p>"Is this," continued Duban, "the return I meet from thee? Thou givest me, meseems, but crocodile boon." Quoth the
      King,"What is the tale of the crocodile?", and quoth the physician, "Impossible for me to tell it in this my
      state; Allah upon thee, spare me, as thou hopest Allah shall spare thee." And he wept with ex ceeding weeping.
      Then one of the King's favourites stood up and said, "O King! grant me the blood of this physician; we have never
      seen him sin against thee, or doing aught save healing thee from a disease which baffled every leach and man of
      science." Said the King, "Ye wot not the cause of my putting to death this physician, and this it is. If I spare
      him, I doom myself to certain death; for one who healed me of such a malady by something held in my hand, surely
      can slay me by something held to my nose; and I fear lest he kill me for a price, since haply he is some spy whose
      sole purpose in coming hither was to compass my destruction. So there is no help for it; die he must, and then
      only shall I be sure of my own life." Again cried Duban, "Spare me and Allah shall spare thee; and slay me not or
      Allah shall slay thee." But it was in vain. Now when the physician, O Ifrit, knew for certain that the King would
      kill him, he said, "O King, if there be no help but I must die, grant me some little delay that I may go down to
      my house and release myself from mine obligations and direct my folk and my neighbours where to bury me and
      distribute my books of medicine. Amongst these I have one, the rarest of rarities, which I would present to thee
      as an offering: keep it as a treasure in thy treasury." "And what is in the book?" asked the King and the Sage
      answered, "Things beyond compt; and the least of secrets is that if, directly after thou hast cut off my head,
      thou open three leaves and read three lines of the page to thy left hand, my head shall speak and answer every
      question thou deignest ask of it." The King wondered with exceeding wonder and shaking with delight at the
      novelty, said, "O physician, cost thou really tell me that when I cut off thy head it will speak to me?" He
      replied, "Yes, O King!" Quoth the King, "This is indeed a strange matter!" and forthwith sent him closely guarded
      to his house, and Duban then and there settled all his obligations. Next day he went up to the King's audience
      hall, where Emirs and Wazirs, Chamberlains and Nabobs, Grandees and Lords of Estate were gathered together, making
      the presence chamber gay as a garden of flower beds. And lo! the physician came up and stood before the King,
      bearing a worn old volume and a little etui of metal full of powder, like that used for the eyes. Then he sat down
      and said, "Give me a tray." So they brought him one and he poured the powder upon it and levelled it and lastly
      spake as follows: "O King, take this book but do not open it till my head falls; then set it upon this tray, and
      bid press it down upon the powder, when forthright the blood will cease flowing. That is the time to open the
      book." The King thereupon took the book and made a sign to the Sworder, who arose and struck off the physician's
      head, and placing it on the middle of the tray, pressed it down upon the powder. The blood stopped flowing, and
      the Sage Duban unclosed his eyes and said, "Now open the book, O King!" The King opened the book, and found the
      leaves stuck together; so he put his finger to his mouth and, by moistening it, he easily turned over the first
      leaf, and in like way the second, and the third, each leaf opening with much trouble; and when he had un stuck six
      leaves he looked over them and, finding nothing written thereon, said, "O physician, there is no writing here!"
      Duban re plied, "Turn over yet more;" and he turned over three others in the same way. Now the book was poisoned;
      and before long the venom penetrated his system, and he fell into strong convulsions and he cried out, "The poison
      hath done its work!" Whereupon the Sage Duban's head began to improvise:—</p>
    <p>There be rulers who have ruled with a foul tyrannic sway *<br />
           But they soon became as though they had never, never been:<br />
      Just, they had won justice: they oppressed and were oppress *<br />
           By Fortune, who requited them with ban and bane and teen:<br />
      So they faded like the morn, and the tongue of things repeats *<br />
           "Take this far that, nor vent upon Fortune's ways thy<br />
           spleen."<br /></p>
    <p>No sooner had the head ceased speaking than the King rolled over dead. Now I would have thee know, O Ifrit, that
      if King Yunan had spared the Sage Duban, Allah would have spared him, but he refused so to do and decreed to do
      him dead, wherefore Allah slew him; and thou too, O Ifrit, if thou hadst spared me, Allah would have spared thee.
      And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say: then quoth Dunyazad, "O my sister,
      how pleasant is thy tale, and how tasteful; how sweet, and how grateful!" She replied, "And where is this compared
      with what I could tell thee this coming night, if I live and the King spare me?" Said the King in himself, "By
      Allah, I will not slay her until I hear the rest of her story, for truly it is wondrous." They rested that night
      in mutual embrace until dawn: then the King went forth to his Darbar; the Wazirs and troops came in and the
      audience hall was crowded; so the King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade and forbade the
      rest of that day, when the court broke up, and King Shahryar entered his palace,</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Sixth Night,</p>
    <p>Her sister, Dunyazad, said to her,"Pray finish for us thy story;" and she answered, "I will if the King give me
      leave." "Say on," quoth the King. And she continued:—It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
      Fisherman said to the Ifrit, "If thou hadst spared me I would have spared thee, but nothing would satisfy thee
      save my death; so now I will do thee die by jailing thee in this jar and I will hurl thee into this sea." Then the
      Marid roared aloud and cried, "Allah upon thee, O Fisher man, don't! Spare me, and pardon my past doings; and, as
      I have been tyrannous, so be thou generous, for it is said among sayings that go current:—O thou who doest good to
      him who hath done thee evil, suffice for the ill doer his ill deeds, and do not deal with me as did Umamah to
      'Atikah." Asked the Fisherman, "And what was their case?" and the Ifrit answered, "This is not the time for story
      telling and I in this prison; but set me free and I will tell thee the tale." Quoth the Fisherman, "Leave this
      language: there is no help but that thou be thrown back into the sea nor is there any way for thy getting out of
      it for ever and ever. Vainly I placed myself under thy protection, and I humbled my self to thee with weeping,
      while thou soughtest only to slay me, who had done thee no injury deserving this at thy hands; nay, so far from
      injuring thee by any evil act, I worked thee nought but weal in releasing thee from that jail of thine. Now I knew
      thee to be an evil doer when thou diddest to me what thou didst, and know, that when I have cast thee back into
      the sea, I will warn whomsoever may fish thee up of what hath befallen me with thee, and I will advise him to toss
      thee back again; so shalt thou abide here under these waters till the End of Time shall make an end of thee." But
      the Ifrit cried aloud, "Set me free; this is a noble occasion for generosity and I make covenant with thee and vow
      never to do thee hurt and harm; nay, I will help thee to what shall put thee out of want." The Fisherman accepted
      his promises on both conditions, not to trouble him as before, but on the contrary to do him service; and, after
      making firm the plight and swearing him a solemn oath by Allah Most Highest he opened the cucurbit. Thereupon the
      pillar of smoke rose up till all of it was fully out; then it thickened and once more became an Ifrit of hideous
      presence, who forthright ad ministered a kick to the bottle and sent it flying into the sea. The Fisherman, seeing
      how the cucurbit was treated and making sure of his own death, piddled in his clothes and said to himself, "This
      promiseth badly;" but he fortified his heart, and cried, "O Ifrit, Allah hath said: - Perform your covenant; for
      the performance of your covenant shall be inquired into hereafter. Thou hast made a vow to me and hast sworn an
      oath not to play me false lest Allah play thee false, for verily he is a jealous God who respiteth the sinner, but
      letteth him not escape. I say to thee as said the Sage Duban to King Yunan, "Spare me so Allah may spare thee!"
      The Ifrit burst into laughter and stalked away, saying to the Fisherman, "Follow me;" and the man paced after him
      at a safe distance (for he was not assured of escape) till they had passed round the suburbs of the city. Thence
      they struck into the uncultivated grounds, and crossing them descended into a broad wilderness, and lo! in the
      midst of it stood a mountain tarn. The Ifrit waded in to the middle and again cried, "Follow me;" and when this
      was done he took his stand in the centre and bade the man cast his net and catch his fish. The Fisherman looked
      into the water and was much astonished to see therein vari coloured fishes, white and red, blue and yellow;
      however he cast his net and, hauling it in, saw that he had netted four fishes, one of each colour. Thereat he
      rejoiced greatly and more when the Ifrit said to him, "Carry these to the Sultan and set them in his presence;
      then he will give thee what shall make thee a wealthy man; and now accept my excuse, for by Allah at this time I
      wot none other way of benefiting thee, inasmuch I have lain in this sea eighteen hundred years and have not seen
      the face of the world save within this hour. But I would not have thee fish here save once a day." The Ifrit then
      gave him God speed, saying, Allah grant we meet again;" and struck the earth with one foot, whereupon the ground
      clove asunder and swallowed him up. The Fisherman, much marvelling at what had happened to him with the Ifrit,
      took the fish and made for the city; and as soon as he reached home he filled an earthen bowl with water and
      therein threw the fish which began to struggle and wriggle about. Then he bore off the bowl upon his head and
      repairing to the King's palace (even as the Ifrit had bidden him) laid the fish before the presence; and the King
      wondered with exceeding wonder at the sight, for never in his lifetime had' he seen fishes like these in quality
      or in conformation. So he said, "Give those fish to the stranger slave girl who now cooketh for us," meaning the
      bond maiden whom the King of Roum had sent to him only three days before, so that he had not yet made trial of her
      talents in the dressing of meat. Thereupon the Wazir carried the fish to the cook and bade her fry them saying, "O
      damsel, the King sendeth this say to thee:—I have not treasured thee, O tear o' me! save for stress time of me;
      approve, then, to us this day thy delicate handiwork and thy savoury cooking; for this dish of fish is a present
      sent to the Sultan and evidently a rarity." The Wazir, after he had carefully charged her, returned to the King,
      who commanded him to give the Fisherman four hundred diners: he gave them accordingly, and the man took them to
      his bosom and ran off home stumbling and falling and rising again and deeming the whole thing to be a dream.
      However, he bought for his family all they wanted and lastly he went to his wife in huge joy and gladness. So far
      concerning him; but as regards the cookmaid, she took the fish and cleansed them and set them in the frying pan,
      basting them with oil till one side was dressed. Then she turned them over and, behold, the kitchen wall crave
      asunder, and therefrom came a young lady, fair of form, oval of face, perfect in grace, with eyelids which Kohl
      lines enchase. Her dress was a silken head kerchief fringed and tasseled with blue: a large ring hung from either
      ear; a pair of bracelets adorned her wrists; rings with bezels of priceless gems were on her fingers; and she hent
      in hand a long rod of rattan cane which she thrust into the frying pan, saying, "O fish! O fish! be ye constant to
      your covenant?" When the cookmaiden saw this apparition she swooned away. The young lady repeated her words a
      second time and a third time, and at last the fishes raised their heads from the pan, and saying in articulate
      speech "Yes! Yes!" began with one voice to recite:—</p>
    <p>Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * And if ye fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!</p>
    <p>After this the young lady upset the frying pan and went forth by the way she came in and the kitchen wall closed
      upon her. When the cook maiden recovered from her fainting fit, she saw the four fishes charred black as charcoal,
      and crying out, "His staff brake in his first bout," she again fell swooning to the ground. Whilst she was in this
      case the Wazir came for the fish and looking upon her as insensible she lay, not knowing Sunday from Thursday,
      shoved her with his foot and said, "Bring the fish for the Sultan!" Thereupon recovering from her fainting fit she
      wept and in formed him of her case and all that had befallen her. The Wazir marvelled greatly and exclaiming,
      "This is none other than a right strange matter!", he sent after the Fisherman and said to him, "Thou, O
      Fisherman, must needs fetch us four fishes like those thou broughtest before." Thereupon the man repaired to the
      tarn and cast his net; and when he landed it, lo! four fishes were therein exactly like the first. These he at
      once carried to the Wazir, who went in with them to the cook maiden and said, "Up with thee and fry these in my
      presence, that I may see this business." The damsel arose and cleansed the fish, and set them in the frying pan
      over the fire; however they remained there but a little while ere the wall crave asunder and the young lady
      appeared, clad as before and holding in hand the wand which she again thrust into the frying pan, saying, "O fish!
      O fish! be ye constant to your olden covenant?" And behold, the fish lifted their heads, and repeated "Yes! Yes!"
      and recited this couplet:</p>
    <p>Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * But if ye<br />
           fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!<br /></p>
    <p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Seventh Night,</p>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the fishes spoke, and the young lady upset the
      frying pan with her rod, and went forth by the way she came and the wall closed up, the Wazir cried out, "This is
      a thing not to be hidden from the King." So he went and told him what had happened, where upon quoth the King,
      "There is no help for it but that I see this with mine own eyes." Then he sent for the Fisherman and commended him
      to bring four other fish like the first and to take with him three men as witnesses. The Fisherman at once brought
      the fish: and the King, after ordering them to give him four hundred gold pieces, turned to the Wazir and said,
      "Up and fry me the fishes here before me!" The Minister, replying "To hear is to obey," bade bring the frying pan,
      threw therein the cleansed fish and set it over the fire; when lo! the wall crave asunder, and out burst a black
      slave like a huge rock or a remnant of the tribe Ad bearing in hand a branch of a green tree; and he cried in loud
      and terrible tones, "O fish! O fish! be ye all constant to your antique covenant?" whereupon the fishes lifted
      their heads from the frying pan and said, "Yes! Yes ! we be true to our vow;" and they again recited the couplet:
    </p>
    <p>Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * But if ye fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!</p>
    <p>Then the huge blackamoor approached the frying pan and upset it with the branch and went forth by the way he came
      in. When he vanished from their sight the King inspected the fish; and finding them all charred black as charcoal,
      was utterly bewildered and said to the Wazir, "Verily this is a matter whereanent silence cannot be kept, and as
      for the fishes, assuredly some marvellous adventure connects with them." So he bade bring the Fisherman and asked
      him, saying "Fie on thee, fellow! whence came these fishes?" and he answered, "From a tarn between four heights
      lying behind this mountain which is in sight of thy city." Quoth the King, "How many days' march?" Quoth he, "O
      our lord the Sultan, a walk of half hour." The King wondered and, straight way ordering his men to march and
      horsemen to mount, led off the Fisherman who went before as guide, privily damning the Ifrit. They fared on till
      they had climbed the mountain and descended unto a great desert which they had never seen during all their lives;
      and the Sultan and his merry men marvelled much at the wold set in the midst of four mountains, and the tarn and
      its fishes of four colours, red and white, yellow and blue. The King stood fixed to the spot in wonderment and
      asked his troops and all present, "Hath any one among you ever seen this piece of water before now?" and all made
      answer, "O King of the age never did we set eyes upon it during all our days." They also questioned the oldest
      inhabitants they met, men well stricken in years, but they replied, each and every, "A lakelet this we never saw
      in this place." Thereupon quoth the King, "By Allah I will neither return to my capital nor sit upon the throne of
      my forbears till I learn the truth about this tarn and the fish therein." He then ordered his men to dismount and
      bivouac all around the mountain; which they did; and summoning his Wazir, a Minister of much experience,
      sagacious, of penetrating wit and well versed in affairs, said to him, "'Tis in my mind to do a certain thing
      whereof I will inform thee; my heart telleth me to fare forth alone this night and root out the mystery of this
      tarn and its fishes. Do thou take thy seat at my tent door, and say to the Emirs and Wazirs, the Nabobs and the
      Chamberlains, in fine to all who ask thee:—The Sultan is ill at ease, and he hath ordered me to refuse all
      admittance; and be careful thou let none know my design." And the Wazir could not oppose him. Then the King
      changed his dress and ornaments and, slinging his sword over his shoulder, took a path which led up one of the
      mountains and marched for the rest of the night till morning dawned; nor did he cease wayfaring till the heat was
      too much for him. After his long walk he rested for a while, and then resumed his march and fared on through the
      second night till dawn, when suddenly there appeared a black point in the far distance. Hereat he rejoiced and
      said to himself, "Haply some one here shall acquaint me with the mystery of the tarn and its fishes." Presently
      drawing near the dark object he found it a palace built of swart stone plated with iron; and, while one leaf of
      the gate stood wide open, the other was shut, The King's spirits rose high as he stood before the gate and rapped
      a light rap; but hearing no answer he knocked a second knock and a third; yet there came no sign. Then he knocked
      his loudest but still no answer, so he said, "Doubtless 'tis empty." Thereupon he mustered up resolution and
      boldly walked through the main gate into the great hall and there cried out aloud, "Holla, ye people of the
      palace! I am a stranger and a wayfarer; have you aught here of victual?" He repeated his cry a second time and a
      third but still there came no reply; so strengthening his heart and making up his mind he stalked through the
      vestibule into the very middle of the palace and found no man in it. Yet it was furnished with silken stuffs gold
      starred; and the hangings were let down over the door ways. In the midst was a spacious court off which set four
      open saloons each with its raised dais, saloon facing saloon; a canopy shaded the court and in the centre was a
      jetting fount with four figures of lions made of red gold, spouting from their mouths water clear as pearls and
      diaphanous gems. Round about the palace birds were let loose and over it stretched a net of golden wire, hindering
      them from flying off; in brief there was everything but human beings. The King marvelled mightily thereat, yet
      felt he sad at heart for that he saw no one to give him account of the waste and its tarn, the fishes, the
      mountains and the palace itself. Presently as he sat between the doors in deep thought behold, there came a voice
      of lament, as from a heart grief spent and he heard the voice chanting these verses:—</p>
    <p>I hid what I endured of him and yet it came to light, *<br />
           And nightly sleep mine eyelids fled and changed to sleepless<br />
           night:<br />
      Oh world! Oh Fate! withhold thy hand and cease thy hurt and<br />
           harm * Look and behold my hapless sprite in colour and<br />
           affright:<br />
      Wilt ne'er show ruth to highborn youth who lost him on the way *<br />
           Of Love, and fell from wealth and fame to lowest basest<br />
           wight.<br />
      Jealous of Zephyr's breath was I as on your form he breathed *<br />
           But whenas Destiny descends she blindeth human sight<br />
      What shall the hapless archer do who when he fronts his foe * And<br />
           bends his bow to shoot the shaft shall find his string<br />
           undight?<br />
      When cark and care so heavy bear on youth of generous<br />
           soul * How shall he 'scape his lot and where from Fate his<br />
           place of flight?<br /></p>
    <p>Now when the Sultan heard the mournful voice he sprang to his feet; and, following the sound, found a curtain let
      down over a chamber door. He raised it and saw behind it a young man sitting upon a couch about a cubit above the
      ground; and he fair to the sight, a well shaped wight, with eloquence dight; his forehead was flower white, his
      cheek rosy bright, and a mole on his cheek breadth like an ambergris mite; even as the poet cloth indite:—</p>
    <p>A youth slim waisted from whose locks and brow * The world in<br />
           blackness and in light is set.<br />
      Throughout Creation's round no fairer show * No rarer sight thine<br />
           eye hath ever met:<br />
      A nut brown mole sits throned upon a cheek * Of rosiest red<br />
           beneath an eye of jet.<br /></p>
    <p>The King rejoiced and saluted him, but he remained sitting in his caftan of silken stuff pureed with Egyptian
      gold and his crown studded with gems of sorts; but his face was sad with the traces of sorrow. He returned the
      royal salute in most courteous wise adding, "O my lord, thy dignity demandeth my rising to thee; and my sole
      excuse is to crave thy pardon." Quoth the King, "Thou art excused, O youth; so look upon me as thy guest come
      hither on an especial object. I would thou acquaint me with the secrets of this tarn and its fishes and of this
      palace and thy loneliness therein and the cause of thy groaning and wailing." When the young man heard these words
      he wept with sore weeping; till his bosom was drenched with tears and began reciting—</p>
    <p>Say him who careless sleeps what while the shaft of Fortune flies<br />
           * How many cloth this shifting world lay low and raise to<br />
           rise?<br />
      Although thine eye be sealed in sleep, sleep not th' Almighty's<br />
           eyes * And who hath found Time ever fair, or Fate in<br />
           constant guise?<br /></p>
    <p>Then he sighed a long fetched sigh and recited:—</p>
    <p>Confide thy case to Him, the Lord who made mankind; * Quit cark<br />
           and care and cultivate content of mind;<br />
      Ask not the Past or how or why it came to pass: * All human<br />
           things by Fate and Destiny were designed!<br /></p>
    <p>The King marvelled and asked him, "What maketh thee weep, O young man?" and he answered, "How should I not weep,
      when this is my case!" Thereupon he put out his hand and raised the skirt of his garment, when lo! the lower half
      of him appeared stone down to his feet while from his navel to the hair of his head he was man. The King, seeing
      this his plight, grieved with sore grief and of his compassion cried, "Alack and well away! in very sooth, O
      youth, thou heapest sorrow upon my sorrow. I was minded to ask thee the mystery of the fishes only: whereas now I
      am concerned to learn thy story as well as theirs. But there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah,
      the Glorious, the Great! Lose no time, O youth, but tell me forthright thy whole tale." Quoth he, "Lend me thine
      ears, thy sight and thine insight;" and quoth the King, "All are at thy service!" Thereupon the youth began,
      "Right wondrous and marvellous is my case and that of these fishes; and were it graven with gravers upon the eye
      corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned." "How is that?" asked the King, and the young man began to tell

    <h3><a id="chap13" />The Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince.</h3>
    <p>Know then, O my lord, that whilome my sire was King of this city, and his name was Mahmud, entitled Lord of the
      Black Islands, and owner of what are now these four mountains. He ruled three score and ten years, after which he
      went to the mercy of the Lord and I reigned as Sultan in his stead. I took to wife my cousin, the daughter of my
      paternal uncle, and she loved me with such abounding love that whenever I was absent she ate not and she drank not
      until she saw me again. She cohabited with me for five years till a certain day when she went forth to the Hammam
      bath; and I bade the cook hasten to get ready all requisites for our supper. And I entered this palace and lay
      down on the bed where I was wont to sleep and bade two damsels to fan my face, one sitting by my head and the
      other at my feet. But I was troubled and made restless by my wife's absence and could not sleep; for although my
      eyes were closed my mind and thoughts were wide awake. Presently I heard the slave girl at my head say to her at
      my feet, "O Mas'udah, how miserable is our master and how wasted in his youth and oh! the pity of his being so be
      trayed by our mistress, the accursed whore!'' The other replied, "Yes indeed: Allah curse all faithless women and
      adulterous; but the like of our master, with his fair gifts, deserveth something better than this harlot who lieth
      abroad every night." Then quoth she who sat by my head, "Is our lord dumb or fit only for bubbling that he
      questioneth her not!" and quoth the other, "Fie on thee! cloth our lord know her ways or cloth she allow him his
      choice? Nay, more, cloth she not drug every night the cup she giveth him to drink before sleep time, and put Bhang
      into it? So he sleepeth and wotteth not whither she goeth, nor what she doeth; but we know that after giving him
      the drugged wine, she donneth her richest raiment and perfumeth herself and then she fareth out from him to be
      away till break of day; then she cometh to him, and burneth a pastile under his nose and he awaketh from his
      deathlike sleep." When I heard the slave girl's words, the light became black before my sight and I thought night
      would never-fall. Presently the daughter of my uncle came from the baths; and they set the table for us and we ate
      and sat together a fair half hour quaffing our wine as was ever our wont. Then she called for the particular wine
      I used to drink before sleeping and reached me the cup; but, seeming to drink it according to my wont, I poured
      the contents into my bosom; and, lying down, let her hear that I was asleep. Then, behold, she cried, "Sleep out
      the night, and never wake again: by Allah, I loathe thee and I loathe thy whole body, and my soul turneth in
      disgust from cohabiting with thee; and I see not the moment when Allah shall snatch away thy life!" Then she rose
      and donned her fairest dress and perfumed her person and slung my sword over her shoulder; and, opening the gates
      of the palace, went her ill way. I rose and followed her as she left the palace and she threaded the streets until
      she came to the city gate, where she spoke words I understood not, and the padlocks dropped of themselves as if
      broken and the gate leaves opened. She went forth (and I after her without her noticing aught) till she came at
      last to the outlying mounds and a reed fence built about a round roofed hut of mud bricks. As she entered the
      door, I climbed upon the roof which commanded a view of the interior, and lo! my fair cousin had gone in to a
      hideous negro slave with his upper lip like the cover of a pot, and his lower like an open pot; lips which might
      sweep up sand from the gravel-floor of the cot. He was to boot a leper and a paralytic, lying upon a strew of
      sugar cane trash and wrapped in an old blanket and the foulest rags and tatters. She kissed the earth before him,
      and he raised his head so as to see her and said, "Woe to thee! what call hadst thou to stay away all this time?
      Here have been with me sundry of the black brethren, who drank their wine and each had his young lady, and I was
      not content to drink because of thine absence." Then she, "O my lord, my heart's love and coolth of my eyes
      knowest thou not that I am married to my cousin whose very look I loathe, and hate myself when in his company? And
      did not I fear for thy sake, I would not let a single sun arise before making his city a ruined heap wherein raven
      should croak and howlet hoot, and jackal and wolf harbour and loot; nay I had removed its very stones to the back
      side of Mount Kaf." Rejoined the slave, Thou liest, damn thee! Now I swear an oath by the velour and honour of
      blackamoor men (and deem not our manliness to be ; the poor manliness of white men), from today forth if thou stay
      away till this hour, I will not keep company with thee nor will I glue my body with thy body and strum and belly
      bump Dost play fast and loose with us, thou cracked pot, that we may satisfy thy dirty lusts? stinkard! bitch!
      vilest of the vile whites!" When I heard his words, and saw with my own eyes what passed between these two
      wretches, the world waxed dark be fore my face and my soul knew not in what place it was. But , my wife humbly
      stood up weeping before and wheedling the slave, and saying, O my beloved, and very fruit of my heart, there is
      none left to cheer me but thy dear self; and, if thou cast me off who shall take me in, O my beloved, O light of
      my eyes?" And she ceased not weeping and abasing herself to him until he deigned be reconciled with her. Then was
      she right glad and stood up and doffed her clothes, even to her petticoat trousers, and said, 0 my master what
      hast thou here for thy handmaiden to eat? Uncover the basin," he grumbled, "and thou shalt find t the bottom the
      broiled bones of some rats we dined on, pick at them, and then go to that slop pot where thou shalt find some
      leavings of beer which thou mayest drink." So she ate and drank and washed her hands, and went and lay down by the
      side of the slave, upon the cane trash and, stripping herself stark naked, she crept in with him under his foul
      coverlet and his rags and tatters. When I saw my wife, my cousin, the daughter of my uncle, do this deed I clean
      lost my wits, and climbing down from the roof, I entered and took the sword which she had with her and drew it,
      determined to cut down the twain. I first struck at the slave's neck and thought that the death decree had fallen
      on him:"And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it was the Eighth Night,</p>
    <p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young ensorcelled Prince said to the King, "When I
      smote the slave with intent to strike off his head, I thought that I had slain him; for he groaned a loud hissing
      groan, but I had cut only the skin and flesh of the gullet and the two arteries! It awoke the daughter of my
      uncle, so I sheathed the sword and fared forth for the city; and, entering the palace, lay upon my bed and slept
      till morning when my wife aroused me and I saw that she had cut off her hair and had donned mourning garments.
      Quoth she:—O son of my uncle, blame me not for what I do; it hath just reached me that my mother is dead, and my
      father hath been killed in holy war, and of my brothers one hath lost his life by a snake sting and the other by
      falling down some precipice; and I can and should do naught save weep and lament. When I heard her words I
      refrained from all reproach and said only:—Do as thou list; I certainly will not thwart thee. She continued
      sorrowing, weeping and wailing one whole year from the beginning of its circle to the end, and when it was
      finished she said to me.—I wish to build me in thy palace a tomb with a cupola, which I will set apart for my
      mourning and will name the House of Lamentations. Quoth I again:—Do as thou list! Then she builded for herself a
      cenotaph wherein to mourn, and set on its centre a dome under which showed a tomb like a Santon's sepulchre.
      Thither she carried the slave and lodged him; but he was exceeding weak by reason of his wound, and unable to do
      her love service; he could only drink wine and from the day of his hurt he spake not a word, yet he lived on
      because his appointed hour was not come. Every day, morning and evening, my wife went to him and wept and wailed
      over him and gave him wine and strong soups, and left not off doing after this manner a second year; and I bore
      with her patiently and paid no heed to her. One day, however, I went in to her unawares; and I found her weeping
      and beating her face and crying:—Why art thou absent from my sight, O my heart's delight? Speak to me, O my life;
      talk with me, O my love? Then she recited these verses:—</p>
    <p>For your love my patience fails and albeit you forget * I may<br />
           not, nor to other love my heart can make reply:<br />
      Bear my body, bear my soul wheresoever you may fare * And<br />
           where you pitch the camp let my body buried lie:<br />
      Cry my name above my grave, and an answer shall return * The<br />
           moaning of my bones responsive to your cry.<br /></p>
    <p>Then she recited, weeping bitterly the while:—</p>
    <p>The day of my delight is the day when draw you near * And the<br />
           day of mine affright is the day you turn away:<br />
      Though I tremble through the night in my bitter dread of death *<br />
           When I hold you in my arms I am free from all affray<br /></p>
    <p>Once more she began reciting:—</p>
    <p>Though a morn I may awake with all happiness in hand *<br />
           Though the world all be mine and like Kisra-kings I<br />
           reign;<br />
      To me they had the worth of the winglet of the gnat * When I fail<br />
           to see thy form, when I look for thee in vain<br /></p>
    <p>When she had ended for a time her words and her weeping I said to her—O my cousin, let this thy mourning suffice,
      for in pouring forth tears there is little profit! Thwart me not, answered she, in aught I do, or I will lay
      violent hands on myself! So I held my peace and left her to go her own way; and she ceased not to cry and keen and
      indulge her affliction for yet another year. At the end of the third year I waxed aweary of this lonesome
      mourning, and one day I happened to enter the cenotaph when vexed and angry with some matter which had thwarted
      me, and suddenly I heard her say:—O my lord, I never hear thee vouch safe a single word to me! Why cost thou not
      answer me, O my master? and she began reciting:—</p>
    <p>O thou tomb! O, thou tomb! be his beauty set in shade? * Hast<br />
           thou darkened that countenance all sheeny as the noon?<br />
      O thou tomb! neither earth nor yet heaven art to me * Then how<br />
           cometh it in thee are conjoined my sun and moon?<br /></p>
    <p>When I heard such verses as these rage was heaped upon my rage I cried out:—Well away! how long is this sorrow to
      last? and I began repeating:—</p>
    <p>O thou tomb! O thou tomb! be his horrors set in blight? * Hast<br />
           thou dark ened his countenance that sickeneth the soul?<br />
      O thou tomb! neither cess pool nor pipkin art to me * Then how<br />
           cometh it in thee are conjoined soil and coal?<br /></p>
    <p>When she heard my words she sprang to her feet crying.—Fie upon thee, thou cur! all this is of thy doings; thou
      hast wounded my heart s darling and thereby worked me sore woe and thou hast wasted his youth so that these three
      years he hath lain abed more dead than alive! In my wrath I cried:—O thou foulest of harlots and filthiest of
      whores ever futtered by negro slaves who are hired to have at thee! Yes indeed it was I who did this good deed;
      and snatching up my sword I drew it and made at her to cut her down. But she laughed my words and mine intent to
      scorn crying: To heel, hound that thou art! Alas for the past which shall no more come to pass nor shall any one
      avail the dead to raise. Allah hath indeed now given into my hand him who did to me this thing, a deed that hath
      burned my heart with a fire which died not and a flame which might not be quenched! Then she stood up; and,
      pronouncing some words to me unintelligible, she said:— By virtue of my egromancy become thou half stone and half
      man; whereupon I became what thou seest, unable to rise or to sit, and neither dead nor alive. Moreover she
      ensorcelled the city with all its streets and garths, and she turned by her gramarye the four islands into four
      mountains around the tarn whereof thou questionest me; and the citizens, who were of four different faiths,
      Moslem, Nazarene, Jew and Magian, she transformed by her enchantments into fishes; the Moslems are the white, the
      Magians red, the Christians blue and the Jews yellow. And every day she tortureth me and scourgeth me with an
      hundred stripes, each of which draweth floods of blood and cutteth the skin of my shoulders to strips; and lastly
      she clotheth my upper half with a hair cloth and then throweth over them these robes." Hereupon the young man
      again shed tears and began reciting:—</p>
    <p>In patience, O my God, I endure my lot and fate; * I will bear at<br />
           will of Thee whatsoever be my state:<br />
      They oppress me; they torture me; they make my life a woe * Yet<br />
           haply Heaven's happiness shall compensate my strait:<br />
      Yea, straitened is my life by the bane and hate o' foes * But<br />
           Mustafa and Murtaza shall ope me Heaven's gate.<br /></p>
    <p>After this the Sultan turned towards the young Prince and said, "O youth, thou hast removed one grief only to add
      another grief; but now, O my friend, where is she; and where is the mausoleum wherein lieth the wounded slave?"
      "The slave lieth under yon dome," quoth the young man, "and she sitteth in the chamber fronting yonder door. And
      every day at sunrise she cometh forth, and first strippeth me, and whippeth me with an hundred strokes of the
      leathern scourge, and I weep and shriek; but there is no power of motion in my lower limbs to keep her off me.
      After ending her tormenting me she visiteth the slave, bringing him wine and boiled meats. And to morrow at an
      early hour she will be here." Quoth the King, "By Allah, O youth, I will as suredly do thee a good deed which the
      world shall not willingly let die, and an act of derring do which shall be chronicled long after I am dead and
      gone by." Then the King sat him by the side of the young Prince and talked till nightfall, when he lay down and
      slept; but, as soon as the false dawn showed, he arose and doffing his outer garments bared his blade and hastened
      to the place wherein lay the slave. Then was he ware of lighted candles and lamps, and the perfume of incenses and
      unguents, and directed by these, he made for the slave and struck him one stroke killing him on the spot: after
      which he lifted him on his back and threw him into a well that was in the palace. Presentry he returned and,
      donning the slave's gear, lay down at length within the mausoleum with the drawn sword laid close to and along his
      side. After an hour or so the accursed witch came; and, first going to her husband, she stripped off his clothes
      and, taking a whip, flogged him cruelly while he cried out, "Ah! enough for me the case I am in! take pity on me,
      O my cousin!' But she replied, "Didst thou take pity on me and spare the life of my true love on whom I coated?"
      Then she drew the cilice over his raw and bleeding skin and threw the robe upon all and went down to the slave
      with a goblet of wine and a bowl of meat broth in her hands. She entered under the dome weeping and wailing,
      "Well-away!" and crying, "O my lord! speak a word to me! O my master! talk awhile with me!" and began to recite
      these couplets.—</p>
    <p>How long this harshness, this unlove, shall bide? * Suffice thee<br />
           not tear floods thou hast espied?<br />
      Thou cost prolong our parting purposely * And if wouldst please<br />
           my foe, thou'rt satisfied!<br /></p>
    <p>Then she wept again and said, "O my lord! speak to me, talk with me!" The King lowered his voice and, twisting
      his tongue, spoke after the fashion of the blackamoors and said "'lack! 'lack! there be no Ma'esty and there be no
      Might save in Allauh, the Gloriose, the Great!" Now when she heard these words she shouted for joy, and fell to
      the ground fainting; and when her senses returned she asked, "O my lord, can it be true that thou hast power of
      speech?" and the King making his voice small and faint answered, "O my cuss! cost thou deserve that I talk to thee
      and speak with thee?" "Why and wherefore?" rejoined she; and he replied "The why is that all the livelong day thou
      tormentest thy hubby; and he keeps calling on 'eaven for aid until sleep is strange to me even from evenin' till
      mawnin', and he prays and damns, cussing us two, me and thee, causing me disquiet and much bother: were this not
      so, I should long ago have got my health; and it is this which prevents my answering thee." Quoth she, "With thy
      leave I will release him from what spell is on him;"and quoth the King, "Release him and let's have some rest!"
      She cried, "To hear is to obey;" and, going from the cenotaph to the palace, she took a metal bowl and filled it
      with water and spake over it certain words which made the contents bubble and boil as a cauldron seetheth over the
      fire. With this she sprinkled her husband saying, "By virtue of the dread words I have spoken, if thou becamest
      thus by my spells, come forth out of that form into shine own former form." And lo and behold! the young man shook
      and trembled; then he rose to his feet and, rejoicing at his deliverance, cried aloud, "I testify that there is no
      god but the God, and in very truth Mohammed is His Apostle, whom Allah bless and keep!" Then she said to him, "Go
      forth and return not hither, for if thou do I will surely slay thee;" screaming these words in his face. So he
      went from between her hands; and she returned to the dome and, going down to the sepulchre, she said, "O my lord,
      come forth to me that I may look upon thee and thy goodliness!" The King replied in faint low words, "What thing
      hast thou done? Thou hast rid me of the branch but not of the root." She asked, "O my darling! O my negro ring!
      what is the root?" And he answered, "Fie on thee, O my cuss! The people of this city and of the four islands every
      night when it's half passed lift their heads from the tank in which thou hast turned them to fishes and cry to
      Heaven and call down its anger on me and thee; and this is the reason why my body's baulked from health. Go at
      once and set them free then come to me and take my hand, and raise me up, for a little strength is already back in
      me." When she heard the King's words (and she still supposed him to be the slave) she cried joyously, O my master,
      on my head and on my eyes be thy commend, Bismillah!'' So she sprang to her feet and, full of joy and gladness,
      ran down to the tarn and took a little of its water n the palm of her hand—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
      and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>
    <p class="center">When it Was the Ninth Night,</p>
    <p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young woman, the sorceress, took in hand some of
      the tarn water and spake over it words not to be understood, the fishes lifted their heads and stood up on the
      instant like men, the spell on the people of the city having been removed. What was the lake again became a
      crowded capital; the bazars were thronged with folk who bought and sold; each citizen was occupied with his own
      calling and the four hills became islands as they were whilome. Then the young woman, that wicked sorceress,
      returned to the King and (still thinking he was the negro) said to him, O my love! stretch forth thy honoured hand
      that I may assist thee to rise." "Nearer to me," quoth the King in a faint and feigned tone. She came close as to
      embrace him when he took up the sword lying hid by his side and smote her across the breast, so that the point
      showed gleaming behind her back. Then he smote her a second time and cut her in twain and cast her to the ground
      in two halves. After which he fared forth and found the young man, now freed from the spell, awaiting him and gave
      him joy of his happy release while the Prince kissed his hand with abundant thanks. Quoth the King, "Wilt thou
      abide in this city or go with me to my capital?" Quoth the youth, "O King of the age, wottest thou not what
      journey is between thee and thy city?" "Two days and a half," answered he, whereupon said the other, "An thou be
      sleeping, O King, awake! Between thee and thy city is a year's march for a well girt walker, and thou haddest not
      come hither in two days and a half save that the city was under enchantment. And I, O King, will never part from
      thee; no, not even for the twinkling of an eye." The King rejoiced at his words and said, "Thanks be to Allah who
      hath bestowed thee upon me! From this hour thou art my son and my only son, for that in all my life I have never
      been blessed with issue." Thereupon they embraced and joyed with exceeding great joy; and, reaching the palace,
      the Prince who had been spell bound informed his lords and his grandees that he was about to visit the Holy Places
      as a pilgrim, and bade them get ready all things necessary for the occasion. The preparations lasted ten days,
      after which he set out with the Sultan, whose heart burned in yearning for his city whence he had been absent a
      whole twelvemonth. They journeyed with an escort of Mamelukes carrying all manners of precious gifts and rarities,
      nor stinted they wayfaring day and night for a full year until they approached the Sultan's capital, and sent on
      messengers to announce their coming. Then the Wazir and the whole army came out to meet him in joy and gladness,
      for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their King; and the troops kissed the ground before him and wished
      him joy of his safety. He entered and took seat upon his throne and the Minister came before him and, when
      acquainted with all that had be fallen the young Prince, he congratulated him on his narrow escape. When order was
      restored throughout the land the King gave largesse to many of his people, and said to the Wazir, "Hither the
      Fisherman who brought us the fishes!" So he sent for the man who had been the first cause of the city and the
      citizens being delivered from enchantment and, when he came in to the presence, the Sultan bestowed upon him a
      dress of honour, and questioned him of his condition and whether he had children. The Fisherman gave him to know
      that he had two daughters and a son, so the King sent for them and, taking one daughter to wife, gave the other to
      the young Prince and made the son his head treasurer. Furthermore he invested his Wazir with the Sultanate of the
