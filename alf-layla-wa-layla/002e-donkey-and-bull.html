    <h3><a id="chap03" />Tale of the Bull and the Ass.</h3>
    <p>Know, O my daughter, that there was once a merchant who owned much money and many men, and who was rich in cattle
      and camels; he had also a wife and family and he dwelt in the country, being experienced in husbandry and devoted
      to agriculture. Now Allah Most High had endowed him with under standing the tongues of beasts and birds of every
      kind, but under pain of death if he divulged the gift to any. So he kept it secret for very fear. He had in his
      cow house a Bull and an Ass each tethered in his own stall one hard by the other. As the merchant was sitting near
      hand one day with his servants and his children were playing about him, he heard the Bull say to the Ass, "Hail
      and health to thee O Father of Waking! for that thou enjoyest rest and good ministering; all under thee is clean
      swept and fresh sprinkled; men wait upon thee and feed thee, and thy provaunt is sifted barley and thy drink pure
      spring water, while I (unhappy creature!) am led forth in the middle of the night, when they set on my neck the
      plough and a something called Yoke; and I tire at cleaving the earth from dawn of day till set of sun. I am forced
      to do more than I can and to bear all manner of ill treatment from night to night; after which they take me back
      with my sides torn, my neck flayed, my legs aching and mine eyelids sored with tears. Then they shut me up in the
      byre and throw me beans and crushed straw, mixed with dirt and chaff; and I lie in dung and filth and foul stinks
      through the livelong night. But thou art ever in a place swept and sprinkled and cleansed, and thou art always
      lying at ease, save when it happens (and seldom enough!) that the master hath some business, when he mounts thee
      and rides thee to town and returns with thee forthright. So it happens that I am toiling and distress while thou
      takest thine ease and thy rest; thou sleepest while I am sleepless; I hunger still while thou eatest thy fill, and
      I win contempt while thou winnest good will." When the Bull ceased speaking, the Ass turned to wards him and said,
      "O Broad o' Brow, 0 thou lost one! he lied not who dubbed thee Bull head, for thou, O father of a Bull, hast
      neither forethought nor contrivance; thou art the simplest of simpletons, and thou knowest naught of good
      advisers. Hast thou not heard the saying of the wise:—</p>
    <p>For others these hardships and labours I bear * And theirs is the<br />
           pleasure and mine is the care;<br />
      As the bleacher who blacketh his brow in the sun * To whiten the<br />
           raiment which other men wear.<br /></p>
    <p>But thou, O fool, art full of zeal and thou toilest and moilest before the master; and thou tearest and wearest
      and slayest thy self for the comfort of another. Hast thou never heard the saw that saith, None to guide and from
      the way go wide? Thou wendest forth at the call to dawn prayer and thou returnest not till sundown; and through
      the livelong day thou endurest all manner hardships; to wit, beating and belabouring and bad language. Now hearken
      to me, Sir Bull! when they tie thee to thy stinking manger, thou pawest the ground with thy forehand and rashest
      out with thy hind hoofs and pushest with thy horns and bellowest aloud, so they deem thee contented. And when they
      throw thee thy fodder thou fallest on it with greed and hastenest to line thy fair fat paunch. But if thou accept
      my advice it will be better for thee and thou wilt lead an easier life even than mine. When thou goest a field and
      they lay the thing called Yoke on thy neck, lie down and rise not again though haply they swinge thee; and, if
      thou rise, lie down a second time; and when they bring thee home and offer thee thy beans, fall backwards and only
      sniff at thy meat and withdraw thee and taste it not, and be satis fied with thy crushed straw and chaff; and on
      this wise feign thou art sick, and cease not doing thus for a day or two days or even three days, so shalt thou
      have rest from toil and moil." When the Bull heard these words he knew the Ass to be his friend and thanked him,
      saying, "Right is thy rede;" and prayed that all blessings might requite him, and cried, "O Father Wakener! thou
      hast made up for my failings." (Now the merchant, O my daughter, understood all that passed between them.) Next
      day the driver took the Bull, and settling the plough on his neck, made him work as wont; but the Bull began to
      shirk his ploughing, according to the advice of the Ass, and the ploughman drubbed him till he broke the yoke and
      made off; but the man caught him up and leathered him till he despaired of his life. Not the less, however, would
      he do nothing but stand still and drop down till the evening. Then the herd led him home and stabled him in his
      stall: but he drew back from his manger and neither stamped nor ramped nor butted nor bellowed as he was wont to
      do; whereat the man wondered. He brought him the beans and husks, but he sniffed at them and left them and lay
      down as far from them as he could and passed the whole night fasting. The peasant came next morning; and, seeing
      the manger full of beans, the crushed straw untasted and the ox lying on his back in sorriest plight, with legs
      outstretched and swollen belly, he was concerned for him, and said to himself, "By Allah, he hath assuredly
      sickened and this is the cause why he would not plough yesterday." Then he went to the merchant and reported, "O
      my master, the Bull is ailing; he refused his fodder last night; nay more, he hath not tasted a scrap of it this
      morning." Now the merchant farmer understood what all this meant, because he had overheard the talk between the
      Bull and the Ass, so quoth he, "Take that rascal donkey, and set the yoke on his neck, and bind him to the plough
      and make him do Bull's work." Thereupon the ploughman took the Ass, and worked him through the live long day at
      the Bull's task; and, when he failed for weakness, he made him eat stick till his ribs were sore and his sides
      were sunken and his neck was hayed by the yoke; and when he came home in the evening he could hardly drag his
      limbs along, either fore hand or hind legs. But as for the Bull, he had passed the day lying at full length and
      had eaten his fodder with an excellent appetite, and he ceased not calling down blessings on the Ass for his good
      advice, unknowing what had come to him on his ac count. So when night set in and the Ass returned to the byte the
      Bull rose up before him in honour, and said, "May good tidings gladden thy heart, O Father Wakener! through thee I
      have rested all this day and I have eaten my meat in peace and quiet." But the Ass returned no reply, for wrath
      and heart burning and fatigue and the beating he had gotten; and he repented with the most grievous of repentance;
      and quoth he to himself: "This cometh of my folly in giving good counsel; as the saw saith, I was in joy and
      gladness, nought save my officiousness brought me this sadness. But I will bear in mind my innate worth and the
      nobility of my nature; for what saith the poet?</p>
    <p>Shall the beautiful hue of the Basil fail * Tho' the<br />
           beetle's foot o'er the Basil crawl?<br />
      And though spider and fly be its denizens * Shall disgrace attach<br />
           to the royal hall?<br />
      The cowrie, I ken, shall have currency * But the pearl's<br />
           clear drop, shall its value fall?<br /></p>
    <p>And now I must take thought and put a trick upon him and return him to his place, else I die." Then he went
      aweary to his manger, while the Bull thanked him and blessed him. And even so, O my daughter, said the Wazir, thou
      wilt die for lack of wits; therefore sit thee still and say naught and expose not thy life to such stress; for, by
      Allah, I offer thee the best advice, which cometh of my affection and kindly solicitude for thee." "O my father,"
      she answered, "needs must I go up to this King and be married to him." Quoth he, "Do not this deed;" and quoth
      she, "Of a truth I will:" whereat he rejoined, "If thou be not silent and bide still, I will do with thee even
      what the merchant did with his wife." "And what did he?" asked she. "Know then, answered the Wazir, that after the
      return of the Ass the merchant came out on the terrace roof with his wife and family, for it was a moonlit night
      and the moon at its full. Now the ter race overlooked the cowhouse and presently, as he sat there with his
      children playing about him, the trader heard the Ass say to the Bull, "Tell me, O Father Broad o' Brow, what thou
      purposest to do to morrow?" The Bull answered, "What but continue to follow thy counsel, O Aliboron? Indeed it was
      as good as good could be and it hath given me rest and repose; nor will I now depart from it one little: so, when
      they bring me my meat, I will refuse it and blow out my belly and counterfeit crank." The Ass shook his head and
      said, "Beware of so doing, O Father of a Bull!" The Bull asked, "Why," and the Ass answered, "Know that I am about
      to give thee the best of counsel, for verily I heard our owner say to the herd, If the Bull rise not from his
      place to do his work this morning and if he retire from his fodder this day, make him over to the butcher that he
      may slaughter him and give his flesh to the poor, and fashion a bit of leather from his hide. Now I fear for thee
      on account of this. So take my advice ere a calamity befal thee; and when they bring thee thy fodder eat it and
      rise up and bellow and paw the ground, or our master will assuredly slay thee: and peace be with thee!" Thereupon
      the Bull arose and lowed aloud and thanked the Ass, and said, "To morrow I will readily go forth with them;" and
      he at once ate up all his meat and even licked the manger. (All this took place and the owner was listening to
      their talk.) Next morning the trader and his wife went to the Bull's crib and sat down, and the driver came and
      led forth the Bull who, seeing his owner, whisked his tail and brake wind, and frisked about so lustily that the
      merchant laughed a loud laugh and kept laughing till he fell on his back. His wife asked him, "Whereat laughest
      thou with such loud laughter as this?"; and he answered her, "I laughed at a secret something which I have heard
      and seen but cannot say lest I die my death." She returned, "Perforce thou must discover it to me, and disclose
      the cause of thy laughing even if thou come by thy death!" But he rejoined, "I cannot re veal what beasts and
      birds say in their lingo for fear I die." Then quoth she, "By Allah, thou liest! this is a mere pretext: thou
      laughest at none save me, and now thou wouldest hide somewhat from me. But by the Lord of the Heavens! an thou
      disclose not the cause I will no longer cohabit with thee: I will leave thee at once." And she sat down and cried.
      Whereupon quoth the merchant, "Woe betide thee! what means thy weeping? Bear Allah and leave these words and query
      me no more questions." "Needs must thou tell me the cause of that laugh," said she, and he replied, "Thou wottest
      that when I prayed Allah to vouchsafe me understanding of the tongues of beasts and birds, I made a vow never to
      disclose the secret to any under pain of dying on the spot." "No matter," cried she, "tell me what secret passed
      between the Bull and the Ass and die this very hour an thou be so minded;" and she ceased not to importune him
      till he was worn out and clean distraught. So at last he said, "Summon thy father and thy mother and our kith and
      kin and sundry of our neighbours," which she did; and he sent for the Kazi and his assessors, intending to make
      his will and reveal to her his secret and die the death; for he loved her with love exceeding because she was his
      cousin, the daughter of his father's brother, and the mother of his children, and he had lived with her a life of
      an hundred and twenty years. Then, having assembled all the family and the folk of his neighbourhood, he said to
      them, "By me there hangeth a strange story, and 'tis such that if I discover the secret to any, I am a dead man."
      Therefore quoth every one of those present to the woman, "Allah upon thee, leave this sinful obstinacy and
      recognise the right of this matter, lest haply thy husband and the father of thy children die." But she rejoined,
      "I will not turn from it till he tell me, even though he come by his death." So they ceased to urge her; and the
      trader rose from amongst them and repaired to an out house to per form Wuzu ablution, and he purposed thereafter
      to return and to tell them his secret and to die. Now, daughter Shahrazad, that mer chant had in his out houses
      some fifty hens under one cock, and whilst making ready to farewell his folk he heard one of his many farm dogs
      thus address in his own tongue the Cock, who was flapping his wings and crowing lustily and jumping from one hen's
      back to another and treading all in turn, saying "O Chanti clear! how mean is thy wit and how shameless is thy
      conduct! Be he disappointed who brought thee up! Art thou not ashamed of thy doings on such a day as this!" "And
      what," asked the Rooster, "hath occurred this day?" when the Dog answered, "Doss thou not know that our master is
      this day making ready for his death? His wife is resolved that he shall disclose the secret taught to him by
      Allah, and the moment he so doeth he shall surely die. We dogs are all a mourning; but thou clappest thy wings and
      clarionest thy loudest and treadest hen after hen. Is this an hour for pastime and pleasuring? Art thou not
      ashamed of thyself?" "Then by Allah," quoth the Cock, "is our master a lack wit and a man scanty of sense: if he
      cannot manage matters with a single wife, his life is not worth prolonging. Now I have some fifty Dame Partlets;
      and I please this and provoke that and starve one and stuff another; and through my good governance they are all
      well under my control. This our master pretendeth to wit and wisdom, and he hath but one wife, and yet knoweth not
      how to manage her." Asked the Dog, "What then, O Cock, should the master do to win clear of his strait?" "He
      should arise forthright," answered the Cock, "and take some twigs from yon mulberry tree and give her a regular
      back basting and rib roasting till she cry:—I repent, O my lord! I will never ask thee a question as long as I
      live! Then let him beat her once more and soundly, and when he shall have done this he shall sleep free from care
      and enjoy life. But this master of ours owns neither sense nor judgment." "Now, daughter Shahrazad," continued the
      Wazir, "I will do to thee as did that husband to that wife." Said Shahrazad, "And what did he do?" He replied,
      "When the merchant heard the wise words spoken by his Cock to his Dog, he arose in haste and sought his wife's
      chamber, after cutting for her some mulberry twigs and hiding them there; and then he called to her, "Come into
      the closet that I may tell thee the secret while no one seeth me and then die." She entered with him and he locked
      the door and came down upon her with so sound a beating of back and shoulders, ribs, arms and legs, saying the
      while, "Wilt thou ever be asking questions about what concerneth thee not?" that she was well nigh senseless.
      Presently she cried out, "I am of the repentant! By Allah, I will ask thee no more questions, and indeed I repent
      sincerely and wholesomely." Then she kissed his hand and feet and he led her out of the room submissive as a wife
      should be. Her parents and all the company rejoiced and sadness and mourn ing were changed into joy and gladness.
      Thus the merchant learnt family discipline from his Cock and he and his wife lived together the happiest of lives
      until death. And thou also, O my daughter!" continued the Wazir, "Unless thou turn from this matter I will do by
      thee what that trader did to his wife." But she answered him with much decision, "I will never desist, O my
      father, nor shall this tale change my purpose. Leave such talk and tattle. I will not listen to thy words and, if
      thou deny me, I will marry myself to him despite the nose of thee. And first I will go up to the King myself and
      alone and I will say to him:—I prayed my father to wive me with thee, but he refused being resolved to disappoint
      his lord, grudging the like of me to the like of thee." Her father asked, "Must this needs be?" and she answered,
      "Even so." Hereupon the Wazir being weary of lamenting and contending, persuading and dissuading her, all to no
      purpose, went up to King Shahryar and after blessing him and kissing the ground before him, told him all about his
      dispute with his daughter from first to last and how he designed to bring her to him that night. The King wondered
      with exceeding wonder; for he had made an especial exception of the Wazir's daughter, and said to him, "O most
      faithful of Counsellors, how is this? Thou wottest that I have sworn by the Raiser of the Heavens that after I
      have gone in to her this night I shall say to thee on the morrow's morning:—Take her and slay her! and, if thou
      slay her not, I will slay thee in her stead without fail." "Allah guide thee to glory and lengthen thy life, O
      King of the age," answered the Wazir, "it is she that hath so determined: all this have I told her and more; but
      she will not hearken to me and she persisteth in passing this coming night with the King's Majesty." So Shahryar
      rejoiced greatly and said, "'Tis well; go get her ready and this night bring her to me." The Wazir returned to his
      daughter and reported to her the command saying, "Allah make not thy father desolate by thy loss!" But Shah razed
      rejoiced with exceeding joy and get ready all she required and said to her younger sister, Dunyazad, "Note well
      what directions I entrust to thee! When I have gone in to the King I will send for thee and when thou comest to me
      and seest that he hath had his carnal will of me, do thou say to me:—O my sister, an thou be not sleepy, relate to
      me some new story, delectable and delightsome, the better to speed our waking hours;" and I will tell thee a tale
      which shall be our deliverance, if so Allah please, and which shall turn the King from his blood thirsty custom."
      Dunyazad answered "With love and gladness." So when it was night their father the Wazir carried Shahrazad to the
      King who was gladdened at the sight and asked, "Hast thou brought me my need?" and he answered, "I have." But when
      the King took her to his bed and fell to toying with her and wished to go in to her she wept; which made him ask,
      "What aileth thee?" She replied, "O King of the age, I have a younger sister and fief would I take leave of her
      this night before I see the dawn." So he sent at once for Dunyazad and she came and kissed the ground between his
      hands, when he permitted her to take her seat near the foot of the couch. Then the King arose and did away with
      his bride's maidenhead and the three fell asleep. But when it was midnight Shahrazad awoke and signalled to her
      sister Dunyazad who sat up and said, "Allah upon thee, O my sister, recite to us some new story, delightsome and
      delectable, wherewith to while away the waking hours of our latter night." "With joy and goodly gree," answered
      Shahrazad, "if this pious and auspicious King permit me." "Tell on," quoth the King who chanced to be sleepless
      and restless and therefore was pleased with the prospect of hearing her story. So Shahrazad rejoiced; and thus, on
      the first night of the Thousand Nights and a Night, she began with the</p>
